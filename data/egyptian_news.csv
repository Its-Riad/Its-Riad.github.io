Egypt’s PM cites optimism on IMF reviews as economic indicators beat targets,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/03/egypts-pm-cites-optimism-on-imf-reviews-as-economic-indicators-beat-targets/,,2025-12-03,,256,0.9120431542396545,"Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly stated on Wednesday that there is “optimism” concerning ongoing talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission, citing positive economic indicators that have surpassed targets in some areas.
Speaking at a weekly press conference following a cabinet meeting at the New Administrative Capital, Madbouly confirmed that the IMF mission arrived two days ago to commence the fifth and sixth reviews of the country’s loan programme. The delegation has already held initial meetings with the Minister of Finance and the Central Bank Governor.
“There is optimism that matters will proceed within a good framework in light of the positive indicators of the Egyptian economy,” Madbouly said.
He added that the country’s economic performance is tracking in line with government hopes, noting that “indeed some economic indicators have achieved better than what was targeted with the Fund.”
In a move to further stimulate the economy, Madbouly announced that President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi has approved the launch of a second package of tax facilities.
Madbouly explained that this is the second of four planned tax packages designed to improve the investment climate and support the private sector’s expansion. The first tranche was implemented last year, with the current package planned for execution this year.
Regarding structural reforms, the Prime Minister said the government is currently updating the “State Ownership Policy Document,” as the original three-year timeframe for the policy expires this December. He expects the final draft of the updated version to be ready by March, after which it will be presented for social dialogue.",2025-12-05T11:27:04.854013
CBE outlines drivers behind October’s rise in inflation,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/22/cbe-outlines-drivers-behind-octobers-rise-in-inflation/,,2025-11-22,,415,0.8845886588096619,"Annual urban headline inflation accelerated to 12.5% in October 2025, up from 11.7% in September, according to data released by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE).
The CBE said the acceleration was primarily driven by higher services prices, especially imputed residential rents, in addition to an uptick in volatile food prices.
Non-food inflation rose to 20.4% in October, compared with 19.1% in September, while annual food inflation edged up slightly to 1.5%, from 1.4% a month earlier.
Annual core inflation also accelerated, reaching 12.1% in October 2025 from 11.3% in September. On a monthly basis, core inflation stood at 2% in October, compared with 1.3% in the same month last year.
The CBE noted that the October increase was mainly driven by a pickup in services inflation, led by a sharp 17.5% rise in imputed rents for housing.
Monthly urban headline inflation rose to 1.8% in October 2025, compared with 1.1% in October 2024. The monthly increase was largely attributable to higher prices of fresh vegetables and services, with retail goods also contributing to a lesser extent.
In rural areas, annual headline inflation decelerated to 7.8% in October, from 8.9% in September. Nationwide, annual headline inflation remained broadly stable at 10.1%, compared with 10.3% a month earlier.
Monthly food inflation reached 1.2% in October, contributing 0.5% to monthly headline inflation.
October’s food inflation was driven by:
A 5% increase in volatile food items, adding 0.32% to monthly headline inflation. While fresh fruit prices fell by 7.6%, fresh vegetables surged by 14.7%, both in line with typical seasonal patterns.
A 5% rise in egg prices, contributing 0.08%.
Monthly non-food inflation recorded 2.2% in October, contributing 1.38% to monthly headline inflation.
The CBE said the rise in non-food inflation was mainly due to:
A 4.5% increase in services prices, adding 1.25% to monthly headline inflation. This was largely driven by the 17.5% rise in imputed housing rents, which alone contributed 1.18%, alongside a slight increase in restaurant and café prices.
A 0.5% increase in retail items, contributing 0.07%, mainly due to slightly higher prices for clothing and footwear, cleaning products, and personal care items.
A 0.2% rise in regulated prices, contributing 0.05%, reflecting a 0.5% increase in tobacco prices and a 0.6% rise in LPG cylinder prices.
Monthly core inflation stood at 2% in October 2025, reflecting the combined impact of changes in core CPI components. Services accounted for 1.74% of the monthly core inflation rate, while core food and retail items contributed 0.20% and 0.10%, respectively.",2025-12-05T11:27:34.728774
Inflation-related risks necessitate cautious monetary-easing approach: CBE,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/22/inflation-related-risks-necessitate-cautious-monetary-easing-approach-cbe/,,2025-11-22,,545,0.8376662135124207,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has cautioned that persistent inflation-related risks necessitate a prudent approach to the ongoing monetary easing cycle.
During its meeting last Thursday, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the CBE’s key policy rates unchanged — maintaining the overnight deposit rate at 21%, the overnight lending rate at 22%, and both the main operation rate and the credit and discount rate at 21.5%. These rates represent the main benchmark for short-term interest movements on the Egyptian pound.
The decision was widely anticipated by economists and investment banks.
So far this year, the CBE has cut interest rates by a cumulative 6.25%, with reductions of 2.25% in April, 1% in May, 2% in August and 1% in October.
In its accompanying statement, the MPC said the decision reflects its assessment of the latest inflation data and expectations since its previous meeting.
Globally, the Committee noted that indicators point to a continued recovery in economic activity, although global forecasts remain clouded by uncertainty over trade policies and persistent geopolitical tensions. Against this backdrop, central banks in advanced and emerging economies have generally taken a cautious stance in easing monetary policy.
On commodity markets, it said oil prices have been broadly stable, while many agricultural commodity prices have retreated. Nonetheless, upside risks to inflation remain, particularly the possibility of renewed disruptions to global supply chains.
Domestically, the MPC said the CBE’s estimates point to a slight improvement in economic growth, with real GDP expanding by 5.2% in the third quarter (Q3) 2025 compared with 5.0% in Q2. This acceleration was supported by strong performance in non-oil manufacturing, trade and tourism. The Committee added that output is expected to continue approaching full capacity, which is anticipated to be reached by the end of fiscal year 2025/2026.
Unemployment rose marginally to 6.4% in Q3 2025, from 6.1% in the previous quarter.
Regarding inflation, the MPC reported that the annual headline inflation rate increased to 12.5% in October 2025 from 11.7% in September. Core inflation also rose, reaching 12.1% in October compared with 11.3% a month earlier. It added that monthly inflation deviated from its typical seasonal pattern due to higher non-food prices — particularly services — which offset the impact of slowing food inflation.
The Committee stressed that further moderation in monthly inflation dynamics is needed for headline inflation to converge toward the CBE’s target.
It added that inflation expectations remain exposed to both global and domestic upside risks, including any escalation in geopolitical tensions, the persistence of services inflation, and fiscal consolidation measures that may exceed earlier projections.
Given these risks, the MPC said it must closely monitor inflation developments and their implications for the outlook, underscoring the need for caution in the monetary easing cycle.
The Committee said it therefore opted for a wait-and-see approach by holding policy rates steady, viewing this stance as appropriate for containing inflationary pressures, anchoring expectations and returning inflation to its downward path.
It reiterated that it will continue to assess its policy decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis, guided by expectations, risk assessments and incoming data. The CBE added that it stands ready to deploy all available tools to achieve price stability and steer inflation toward its target of 7% (± 2%) on average in Q4 2026.",2025-12-05T11:27:37.611836
"Egypt’s annual urban inflation rises to 12.5% in October, driven by higher fuel prices",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/10/egypts-annual-urban-inflation-rises-to-12-5-in-october-driven-by-higher-fuel-prices/,,2025-11-10,,321,-0.6626378893852234,"Egypt’s annual urban inflation rate rose to 12.5% in October 2025, up from 11.7% in September, according to the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS).
The increase was largely driven by higher fuel prices, following the government’s decision to raise petroleum product prices by 10.5–12.9% in October.
The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) reported that monthly core consumer price index (CPI) climbed to 2% in October 2025, compared with 1.5% in September 2025 and 1.3% in October 2024. On an annual basis, core inflation reached 12.1%, up from 11.3% the previous month.
Meanwhile, the nationwide annual inflation rate eased slightly to 10.1% in October, compared to 10.3% in September, CAPMAS said.
The CPI for the entire country reached 264.3 points in October, marking a 1.3% monthly increase. CAPMAS attributed the rise to higher costs in several key categories, particularly food, clothing, housing, and utilities.
Notable price gains were recorded in grains and bread, meat and poultry, dairy products, oils and fats, vegetables, sugar and confectionery, beverages, and tobacco. Prices of textiles, ready-made clothing, footwear, rent, and household maintenance also moved higher.
In contrast, fish and seafood prices declined by 0.3%, fruits fell by 10.6%, and audio-visual equipment, computers, and hotel services registered minor decreases.
Looking ahead, the CBE projects average annual headline inflation to ease to 14% in 2025 and 10.5% in 2026, down from 28.3% in 2024, before converging toward its medium-term target of 7% (±2%) by Q4 2026 and 5% (±2%) by Q4 2028.
At its October meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut key interest rates by one percentage point, bringing the deposit rate to 21%, the lending rate to 22%, and the main operation and discount rates to 21.5%.
The committee said the move supports the decline in inflation expectations and reinforces monetary policy consistency, while warning that inflation remains subject to upside risks, including potential administrative price adjustments and geopolitical tensions in the region.",2025-12-05T11:27:40.349112
CBE projects inflation to average 10.5% in 2026 as economic recovery gains momentum,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/01/cbe-projects-inflation-to-average-10-5-in-2026-as-economic-recovery-gains-momentum/,,2025-11-01,,1406,0.0,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has projected a continued decline in inflation over the next two years, with annual headline inflation expected to average 14.0% in 2025 and 10.5% in 2026, compared to 28.3% in 2024. The Bank anticipates inflation will gradually converge towards its target of 7% (±2%) on average by the fourth quarter of 2026, signalling steady progress toward price stability following two years of inflationary pressures.
In its Q3 2025 Monetary Policy Report, the CBE emphasised that while the disinflation trend remains broadly intact, it continues to face upside risks from both domestic and global fronts. These include a higher-than-expected passthrough from fiscal consolidation measures, global commodity price volatility, and potential geopolitical flare-ups that could disrupt trade and energy markets.
Monetary Policy Report: Anchoring Transparency and Expectations
The CBE’s latest report underscores its ongoing efforts to enhance monetary policy transparency and strengthen public confidence in its inflation-targeting framework. It presents a detailed analysis of global and domestic developments, shedding light on inflation dynamics, growth trends, and financial conditions shaping the Egyptian economy in the third quarter of 2025.
The report also provides an outlook section offering a forward-looking assessment of headline inflation and real economic activity. This analysis is supported by an evaluation of the prevailing balance of risks, ensuring a data-driven approach to policymaking and market guidance.
Additionally, the report includes three thematic boxes highlighting critical aspects of monetary policy conduct:
The Basic Institutional Design of an Inflation Targeting Regime, exploring the structural underpinnings of Egypt’s transition toward a full-fledged framework.
Headline vs. Core Inflation, analysing the interplay between the two indicators and their implications for policy calibration.
Economic Activity and Employment: Does Okun’s Law Hold for Egypt?, which examines the empirical relationship between output and employment in the Egyptian context.
Economic Outlook: Growth Gathers Pace
Real GDP growth is expected to strengthen in the coming fiscal years, with projections of 4.8% in FY 2025/26 and 5.1% in FY 2026/27, according to the CBE. This acceleration will be driven primarily by robust performance in key sectors such as manufacturing, extractions, and services, alongside progress in monetary easing that is expected to bolster real private-sector credit growth.
The forecast also factors in a gradual recovery in Suez Canal revenues, underpinned by the expected normalisation of maritime activity in the Red Sea following the recent Gaza armistice. The CBE projects that the output gap will continue to narrow over the forecast horizon, with overall output levels approaching their potential by the end of FY 2025/26 — an indicator of a healthier, more balanced economy.
Global Developments: Moderating Inflation and Renewed Capital Flows
Globally, economic growth continued to recover in the second quarter of 2025 and is anticipated to maintain its momentum in the third quarter, albeit at a slower pace. This expansion is largely driven by emerging market economies, while developed markets exhibit moderate growth amid cautious monetary easing.
Global inflation has been moderating steadily, approaching central banks’ target ranges as commodity prices—particularly energy and food—have continued to ease. Energy prices stabilised, while international food prices declined for the fourth consecutive month through September 2025.
Improving inflation dynamics prompted central banks in both advanced and emerging economies to cautiously advance their monetary easing cycles, leading to more accommodative global financial conditions. This shift has resulted in a notable increase in capital inflows to emerging markets, including Egypt, where investor sentiment has been further reinforced by improving macroeconomic fundamentals and progress on structural reforms.
Egypt’s Sovereign Rating Upgraded by S&P
In a significant vote of confidence, S&P Global Ratings upgraded Egypt’s long-term sovereign credit rating from ‘B-’ to ‘B’ in October 2025, reflecting enhanced confidence in the country’s economic outlook. The upgrade was supported by the continued implementation of reform measures, stronger real growth, and improving external sector indicators, including rising reserves and healthier balance-of-payments dynamics.
The agency also noted Egypt’s commitment to fiscal discipline and the CBE’s effective inflation management, which together contribute to a more sustainable macroeconomic trajectory. The rating upgrade is expected to further reduce Egypt’s borrowing costs in international markets and enhance its attractiveness to portfolio and direct investors.
Domestic Developments: Inflation Eases and Growth Broadens
Domestically, the inflation outlook has shown clear signs of improvement. Annual headline inflation decelerated to an average of 12.5% in Q3 2025, compared to 15.2% in Q2, driven largely by a pronounced decline in food inflation, which has now reverted to pre-2022 levels.
Core inflation also moderated to 11.2%, down from 11.6% in the previous quarter, reflecting lower cost pressures and an easing in supply chain disruptions. Nonetheless, non-food inflation remained relatively persistent, fuelled by higher service costs—particularly rents—and moderate adjustments in administered prices.
The CBE’s nowcast for Q3 2025 signals a continued recovery in economic activity, with quarterly growth expected to hover around 5%. Key growth drivers include non-petroleum manufacturing, tourism, and the Suez Canal, which have all shown robust post-crisis recoveries.
Real Sector Performance and Demand Dynamics
Egypt’s real GDP at market prices expanded by 5.0% in Q2 2025, marking the fastest growth since early 2022. This strong performance lifted FY 2024/25 growth to 4.4%, up sharply from 2.4% in the previous year.
The rebound was primarily fuelled by higher private consumption and gross domestic investment, particularly in construction, manufacturing, and technology-driven sectors. The CBE expects demand-side inflationary pressures to remain contained, supported by the prevailing monetary policy stance and the projected path of the output gap.
Labour Market Trends and Wage Developments
In the labour market, real wages recorded positive growth for the fourth consecutive quarter during Q2 2025. While this improvement reflects a gradual recovery in household purchasing power, wage levels remain below their 2022 averages, suggesting limited inflationary pressure from the wage channel. Employment growth was strongest in manufacturing, logistics, and tourism—sectors that have benefited most from renewed investment and demand recovery.
External Sector: Current Account Improves and Reserves Strengthen
The current account deficit narrowed by 41% year-on-year in Q2 2025, driven by sustained increases in workers’ remittances, tourism receipts, and transport revenues, particularly from the Suez Canal. However, this improvement was partly offset by a wider hydrocarbon trade deficit, due to higher natural gas imports to meet local consumption needs.
Meanwhile, the financial account surplus remained robust, underpinned by continued foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows sufficient to cover the current account deficit. Consequently, Egypt’s overall balance of payments registered only a marginal deficit of $0.2bn in Q2 2025—a marked improvement over previous quarters.
On the monetary front, M2 money supply growth continued to slow, averaging 22.6% in Q3 2025, compared to 24.2% in Q2, reflecting tighter liquidity management and declining inflation expectations.
Monetary and Financial Conditions
The CBE reported a substantial improvement in net foreign assets (NFAs) within the banking system, which increased by $3bn between June and August 2025 to reach $17.9bn. This gain was primarily driven by commercial banks’ improved foreign exchange positions, sustained remittance inflows, and renewed portfolio investments.
Private-sector credit also expanded strongly, with local currency loans growing by 14.5% in Q3 2025, up from 12.6% in the previous quarter. The expansion reflects stronger credit demand and improving business confidence, supported by the CBE’s gradual monetary easing cycle, which saw cumulative policy rate cuts of 625 basis points in 2025.
The Bank noted that approximately 97% of policy rate cuts were transmitted to the interbank market, where the overnight rate averaged 23.6% in Q3 2025, down from 27.5% in Q1, confirming effective policy transmission.
Financial Markets and Sovereign Yields
Egyptian Eurobond yields declined by an average of 66 basis points in Q3 2025, continuing their downward trajectory since the start of FY 2024/25. This reflects more accommodative global financial conditions, declining sovereign risk, and a more sustainable macroeconomic position.
Improved investor confidence, combined with the sovereign rating upgrade and stronger fundamentals, is expected to further ease external financing pressures and support capital inflows into Egypt’s debt and equity markets over the medium term.
Optimistic outlook
The CBE’s latest projections signal a cautiously optimistic outlook for Egypt’s economy. With inflation on a downward path, growth gaining momentum, and external accounts improving, macroeconomic stability appears to be gradually taking hold.
Nevertheless, the Bank emphasises that continued structural reforms, fiscal discipline, and geopolitical stability will be essential to sustain this progress and reinforce resilience against external shocks.
If current trends persist, 2026 could mark a turning point for Egypt—ushering in a new phase of stable growth, anchored inflation, and renewed investor confidence in the country’s long-term prospects.",2025-12-05T11:27:43.160518
CBE attributes inflation slowdown to easing food prices for fourth consecutive month,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/19/cbe-attributes-inflation-slowdown-to-easing-food-prices-for-fourth-consecutive-month/,,2025-10-19,,416,-0.7981119155883789,"Egypt’s annual urban headline inflation declined to 11.7% in September 2025, down from 12% in August, marking the fourth consecutive month of moderation, according to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). This deceleration was primarily driven by a sharp slowdown in annual food inflation, which dropped to 1.4% in September—its lowest level since April 2021.
While food inflation eased significantly, non-food inflation remained relatively stable. It has hovered around 20.8% since the beginning of the year and recorded 19.1% in September. However, annual core inflation—which excludes volatile items such as food and energy—accelerated to 11.3% in September from 10.7% in August. This uptick was largely attributed to rising services inflation, most notably a 12% increase in rents. Monthly core inflation reached 1.5%, compared to 1.0% in the same month last year.
Monthly urban headline inflation recorded a rate of 1.8% in September 2025, slightly below the 2.1% registered in September 2024. This monthly increase was mainly driven by higher prices for fresh fruits and vegetables as well as services.
In rural areas, headline inflation also eased, falling to 8.9% in September from 10.3% in August. On a national level, annual headline inflation declined to 10.3%, compared to 11.2% the previous month.
Despite the annual slowdown in food inflation, monthly food inflation rose to 2% in September. This increase contributed 0.7% to the monthly headline inflation rate. The rise was mainly due to increases in prices of volatile food items, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. Fresh fruit prices increased by 5.6%, while fresh vegetables rose by 15.5%. Egg prices also increased by 5.7%, contributing further to the monthly rate.
Services prices climbed by 3.2% in September, contributing 0.89% to monthly headline inflation. The notable rise in rents accounted for 0.74% of this figure, alongside increased spending in restaurants and cafés.
Retail item prices rose by 0.8% during the month, contributing 0.11%. This was mainly due to higher prices of household appliances, cleaning supplies, and personal care products, in addition to seasonal increases in clothing, stationery, and school supplies associated with the start of the academic year.
Regulated prices saw a smaller increase of 0.3%, contributing 0.07% to monthly inflation. This was driven by a 0.8% rise in tobacco prices and a 1.1% increase in the price of LPG butane gas cylinders.
Monthly core inflation reflected the cumulative impact of these developments, recording 1.5% in September. The main driver was the services category, which contributed 1.2%, followed by retail items and core food, contributing 0.2% and 0.1% respectively.",2025-12-05T11:27:45.885434
"Inflation expectations still face upside risks domestically, globally: CBE",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/04/inflation-expectations-still-face-upside-risks-domestically-globally-cbe/,,2025-10-04,,711,0.8450029492378235,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has stated that inflation expectations remain exposed to upside risks stemming from both domestic and global factors, including regulated price adjustments exceeding projections and rising geopolitical tensions in the region.
At its meeting last Thursday, the CBE’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to reduce the bank’s key policy rates by 1 percentage point, setting the overnight deposit rate at 21%, the overnight lending rate at 22%, and both the main operation rate and the discount rate at 21.5%.
In a statement following the meeting, the MPC said the decision reflects its assessment of the latest inflation developments and the evolving outlook since its previous meeting, noting that the move aims to sustain the disinflation process while maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Global Context: Gradual Easing and Stable Inflation Expectations
On the global front, the Committee observed that recent indicators point to a moderate recovery in growth, accompanied by stable inflation expectations. As a result, many central banks in advanced and emerging economies have continued to ease monetary policy gradually, responding to fast-changing global conditions.
Oil prices have largely remained stable, though some recent upward pressures have emerged due to supply factors. Meanwhile, agricultural commodity prices have exhibited mixed but limited movements.
Despite these stabilising trends, the MPC warned that global growth and inflation remain vulnerable to several risks — most notably the potential escalation of geopolitical tensions and ongoing uncertainty surrounding global trade policies.
Domestic Economy: Growth Accelerates but Remains Below Potential
Domestically, Egypt’s real GDP growth accelerated to 5% in the second quarter (Q2) of 2025, up from 4.8% in the previous quarter. Consequently, average growth for FY 2024/2025 reached 4.4%, compared with 2.4% in FY 2023/2024.
This improvement was primarily driven by non-oil manufacturing, tourism, and trade, which collectively supported the ongoing recovery in economic activity.
However, the MPC noted that output still remains below potential, meaning that current levels of economic activity continue to support the anticipated short-term disinflation path. Under the present monetary policy stance, demand-side inflationary pressures are expected to stay contained.
Inflation Dynamics: Easing Headline and Core Rates
The Committee reported that annual headline inflation fell to 12% in August 2025, down from 13.9% in July, while annual core inflation declined to 10.7% from 11.6%.
This moderation, according to the MPC, reflects subdued monthly inflation developments in August — 0.4% for headline inflation and 0.1% for core inflation — largely driven by declining food prices and relative stability in non-food components.
The MPC highlighted that the broad-based easing in monthly inflation over the past three months signals improving inflation expectations and the gradual unwinding of previous supply shocks.
In light of these developments, CBE estimates indicate that inflation will continue to decelerate, averaging between 12% and 13% in the third quarter (Q3) of the current year, compared with 15.2% in the previous quarter.
Over the medium term, inflation is projected to continue its downward trend, albeit at a slower pace, shaped by gradual declines in non-food inflation and the impact of ongoing fiscal consolidation measures.
Policy Outlook: Sustaining the Disinflation Path
According to the MPC’s projections, average headline inflation is expected to hover around 14% in 2025, approaching the CBE’s target range by Q4 2026.
“Given the progress achieved in disinflation and the improved inflation outlook, the Committee judged that cutting the CBE’s key policy rates by 100 basis points was appropriate to anchor expectations and support the anticipated disinflation path,” the statement said.
The MPC reaffirmed its data-dependent approach, emphasising that the pace of future monetary easing will be assessed on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Decisions will continue to depend on the evolving inflation outlook, risk balance, and incoming data.
It added that the CBE remains fully committed to achieving price stability, and “will not hesitate to use all available monetary tools” to guide inflation toward its targets of 7% (±2%) in Q4 2026 and 5% (±2%) in Q4 2028, on average.
The MPC’s latest rate cut reflects confidence in Egypt’s ongoing disinflation trend amid improving inflation expectations, stronger growth momentum, and continued stability in global prices. However, the CBE cautioned that risks remain tilted to the upside, particularly from potential regulated price adjustments and heightened geopolitical tensions, underscoring the need for vigilance as it calibrates the path of monetary easing.",2025-12-05T11:27:48.666131

The event is attended by governors of Arab central banks and representatives from regional and international financial institutions.
“I am honoured to participate in the current session… which serves as an annual platform for regional dialogue and cooperation on economic and monetary trends,” Abdalla said in a statement. He noted that this year’s session comes at a critical time, in light of the challenges confronting the global economy, particularly those arising from trade wars, which demand “precise and timely responses from central banks.”
Abdalla underscored that “encouraging increased domestic production and strengthening productive capacities are two core pillars in containing inflationary pressures and achieving long-term economic stability.” He affirmed the commitment of central banks to advancing their tools in line with the evolving global economic landscape, ensuring price stability while supporting economic resilience.
The ongoing session, chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank of Sudan, addresses several key topics, including the challenges central banks face in managing shocks from trade wars, frameworks to strengthen cybersecurity, and the progress of the Comprehensive Instant Digital Payments Initiative in Arab Countries.
The session will also review the outcomes of technical committees specialising in banking supervision, financial inclusion, green financing, and financial stability. A closed session is scheduled to discuss preparations for the third round of mutual evaluations and the challenges facing the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.

"Egypt’s urban inflation slows to 12% in August, down from 13.9% in July",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/09/10/egypts-urban-inflation-slows-to-12-in-august-down-from-13-9-in-july/,,2025-09-10,,365,-0.9423426389694214,"The Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) announced that Egypt’s annual urban inflation rate slowed to 12% in August 2025, compared to 13.9% in July. Nationwide inflation also decelerated, falling to 11.2% from 13.1% over the same period.
The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) reported that monthly core inflation—which excludes volatile items such as food and energy—rose by just 0.1% in August, down from 0.9% in August 2024 and recovering from a negative 0.3% in July 2025. On an annual basis, core inflation dropped to 10.7% in August from 11.6% the previous month.
The CBE forecasts that headline inflation will average between 14 and 15% for the full year, in line with its decline to 15.2% in the second quarter of 2025, down from 16.5% in the first quarter.
In light of the easing inflationary trend, the CBE’s Monetary Policy Committee decided on 28 August to cut key interest rates by 200 basis points. The overnight deposit rate now stands at 22%, the overnight lending rate at 23%, and both the credit and discount rate and the main operation rate at 22.5%.
According to the committee, the decision reflects its assessment of recent inflation developments and projections since its last meeting on 10 July. The CBE stated that demand-side inflationary pressures are expected to remain limited, supported by tight monetary policy and consistent with the short-term downward trend in inflation.
The bank reiterated its commitment to returning inflation to its target range of 7% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2026, and further to 5% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2028. However, it warned that inflation remains subject to upside risks, including changes in administratively set prices and rising geopolitical tensions in the region.
The CBE noted that the interest rate cut is consistent with maintaining a policy stance that anchors expectations and supports the anticipated disinflation path. It emphasized that the pace of monetary easing will be determined on a meeting-by-meeting basis, based on updated forecasts, economic data, and associated risks. The bank added that it will continue to closely monitor economic and financial conditions and use all available tools to ensure price stability and guide inflation toward its medium-term targets.",2025-12-05T11:27:54.120295
CBE projects inflation to ease to 14–15% in 2025,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/08/30/cbe-projects-inflation-to-ease-to-14-15-in-2025/,,2025-08-30,,523,-0.9495781064033508,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) expects headline inflation to decline to between 14% and 15% in 2025, after slowing to 15.2% in the second quarter compared with 16.5% in the first. The projection was announced following the latest meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which cut key interest rates by two percentage points in a move intended to support the disinflationary trend.
The overnight deposit rate was lowered to 22%, the overnight lending rate to 23%, while both the main operation rate and the credit and discount rate were set at 22.5%. The MPC explained that the decision reflected its assessment of recent inflation developments and expectations, building on signs of easing pressures across the domestic economy.
Globally, recent months have seen a gradual recovery in growth alongside stabilising inflation expectations. This has encouraged central banks in advanced and emerging markets to ease monetary policy, albeit cautiously, given continuing uncertainty. Commodity markets remain mixed, with oil prices fluctuating due to supply dynamics, while agricultural prices have followed divergent paths. Despite these developments, risks to global growth and inflation persist, particularly from geopolitical tensions and disruptions to trade policy.
Domestically, preliminary CBE data suggest stronger-than-expected economic growth in the second quarter of 2025, supported mainly by non-oil manufacturing and tourism. Real GDP is now projected to expand by 5.4% in the quarter, with the fiscal year 2024/2025 expected to record average growth of 4.5%, compared with 2.4% in 2023/2024. Labour market conditions also improved, with unemployment falling to 6.1% in the second quarter, down from 6.3% in the first.
Inflation data show further signs of relief. Annual headline inflation slowed to 13.9% in July 2025, from 14.9% in June, while core inflation was broadly stable at 11.6% compared with 11.4% a month earlier. On a monthly basis, both headline and core inflation recorded negative rates in July, at -0.5% and -0.3% respectively, marking a second consecutive month of contraction. These negative monthly readings underline the easing of inflationary pressures and point to improved expectations, supported by monetary policy and more stable exchange rate conditions.
The CBE therefore expects inflation to average between 14% and 15% over the course of 2025, before gradually approaching its target range. According to the outlook, inflation is forecast to converge towards the CBE’s target of 7% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2026, and further towards 5% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2028.
Nevertheless, the MPC cautioned that the inflation path remains exposed to several upside risks. Chief among these are the possibility of administered price adjustments exceeding expectations, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions that could disrupt global supply chains and commodity markets.
Against this backdrop, the Committee judged that cutting policy rates by 200 basis points was appropriate to maintain a monetary stance that anchors expectations and supports the anticipated decline in inflation. The MPC stressed that future policy decisions will continue to be data-dependent, taken on a meeting-by-meeting basis, and guided by inflation expectations, risk assessments, and domestic and external developments.
The Committee reaffirmed its commitment to closely monitor economic and financial conditions and to deploy all available instruments to safeguard price stability.",2025-12-05T11:27:56.888979

Looking ahead
The upcoming decision comes at a critical juncture for Egypt’s economy. Policymakers are seeking to sustain the progress achieved in curbing inflation while simultaneously laying the groundwork for stronger private sector activity, investment inflows, and growth momentum. The debate now centres not on whether rates will be cut, but by how much — and how rapidly the easing cycle will unfold in the months ahead.
At its last meeting on 10 July, the MPC opted to keep its key rates unchanged: 24% for overnight deposits, 25% for overnight lending, and 24.5% for both the credit and discount rate and the main operation rate. That pause followed two successive rate cuts earlier in the year: a 225-basis-point reduction on 17 April and a further 100 basis points on 22 May.
In its July communiqué, the Committee explained that maintaining rates was “preferable” in order to allow time to assess the effects of new fiscal measures — including amendments to the value-added tax law and changes in administered prices — on inflationary dynamics. The MPC underscored that its decisions would continue to be data-dependent and conditional on the inflation outlook, potential risks, and external developments.
Inflation picture: A steady decline
Latest figures suggest that inflationary pressures have been easing consistently since the start of the year.
Core inflation
, as measured by the CBE, stood at 11.6% in July, up slightly from 11.4% in June but still well below last year’s peaks. On a monthly basis, core consumer prices actually declined by 0.3% in July, compared to a 0.2% decline in June.
Urban headline inflation
, published by CAPMAS, fell to 13.9% in July from 14.9% in June. The monthly urban CPI contracted by 0.5% in July after a 0.1% drop in June — further evidence that disinflationary forces are gaining strength.
The CBE projects that annual headline inflation will remain broadly stable at current levels for the rest of 2025 before resuming a gradual decline in 2026, converging towards the medium-term target of 7% (±2%) on average in Q4 2026. Much of this trajectory hinges on the impact of non-food price adjustments, global commodity trends, and fiscal consolidation measures.
Mohamed Abdel Aal
Expert views: Divided between 1% and 2% cuts
Banking veteran Mohamed Abdel Aal expects the MPC to opt for a 200-basis-point cut, resuming the easing cycle after July’s pause.
“Both headline and core inflation have now stabilised — at 13.9% and 11.6% respectively — largely due to lower food and beverage prices, which offset pressures from non-food inflation linked to administered price adjustments,” he said.
According to Abdel Aal, external disinflationary forces are reinforcing the trend. “Global declines in raw materials and imported goods prices are cushioning the domestic impact of subsidy rationalisation and higher VAT. This will likely allow inflation to continue falling through year-end.”
He argued that the CBE now has space to reduce rates without jeopardising stability:
Macroeconomic indicators remain broadly stable.
Global geopolitical tensions have eased somewhat.
Real interest rates have widened to levels that risk stifling private sector recovery.
“By year-end, I expect a total of 400 basis points in cumulative cuts, bringing the key rate closer to 20%,” Abdel Aal said. “A 200-basis-point cut would send the right signal.”
Still, he cautioned that the MPC could decide to remain conservative, particularly if it wishes to gauge the effects of customs duties or renewed regional instability.
Furthermore, HC Securities’ research team also forecasts a 2% cut, pointing to improved external indicators.
Macroeconomic analyst Heba Mounir highlighted several stabilising factors:
The Egyptian pound has appreciated around 5% year-to-date.
Egypt’s one-year credit default swap (CDS) spread has narrowed, signalling reduced sovereign risk.
Workers’ remittances have increased, bolstering FX inflows.
Net international reserves have expanded, providing a stronger buffer.
The banking system’s net foreign asset position has improved.
In parallel, Egypt’s domestic debt market continues to attract foreign participation. The latest 12-month Treasury bill auction cleared at 26.08%, equivalent to a positive real yield of 6.66% (after tax, based on HC’s inflation estimate).
“Despite expectations of rising energy costs, the MPC has room to cut rates by 200 basis points,” Mounir argued. “Slowing inflation, stronger external accounts, and the appreciation of the pound all strengthen the case.”
In contrast, banking analyst Shaimaa Wagih believes the MPC will prefer a more measured approach — a 100-basis-point cut.
“The CBE must strike a delicate balance: supporting growth while ensuring financial stability,” she said. “Inflation has slowed, but risks remain from Egypt’s foreign currency financing needs and potential capital outflows if yields fall too quickly.”
She noted that:
A gradual 1% cut would help ease borrowing costs for businesses and households without creating undue pressure on the pound.
Cheaper credit would boost investment, lending, and liquidity in the stock market.
The government would benefit from lower debt servicing costs, freeing fiscal space for social and developmental spending.
However, she cautioned that overly aggressive cuts could deter foreign investors in Treasury bills and bonds. “Capital flows need close monitoring,” she stressed. “A cautious pace avoids the risk of inflationary rebound.”
For Wagih, the most “professional” scenario is therefore a modest 100-basis-point cut that signals commitment to easing without triggering instability.

Market surveys: Consensus on cuts
Two major international surveys reinforce expectations of a rate reduction:
A
Reuters poll
of economists found consensus around a 100-basis-point cut at Thursday’s meeting, aimed at supporting growth amid declining inflation.
A
Bloomberg survey
of eight investment banks reached a similar conclusion, with most forecasting at least a 100-basis-point cut. Only two institutions anticipated rates remaining unchanged.
Among the banks participating in the surveys were EFG Holding, Naeem, Zeila Capital, CI Capital, Ahli Pharos, Prime, Mubasher Financial Services, Thndr, Cairo Capital, and Arabia Online.
Heba Mounir
Implications for the economy
1. Private sector revival
Lower interest rates would reduce financing costs for businesses, encouraging investment and expansion. This is particularly important for Egypt’s manufacturing and SME sectors, which have been squeezed by years of tight monetary conditions.
2. Banking sector dynamics
While banks could face narrower margins on interest spreads, this may be offset by stronger lending volumes. Retail credit — from mortgages to consumer loans — is likely to benefit, while corporate borrowing could regain momentum.
3. Capital markets boost
The stock market could see renewed liquidity as investors rebalance portfolios away from short-term debt instruments. Historically, rate cuts have been accompanied by rallies in equities, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and banking.
4. Fiscal relief
Lower rates would ease the government’s debt servicing burden. With debt costs consuming a significant portion of expenditure, even a modest reduction could free resources for public investment, infrastructure, and social protection.
5. Risks to manage
The main risks lie in external financing and the pound’s stability. A sudden outflow of foreign portfolio investment or a spike in energy import costs could put pressure on the exchange rate. This explains why some analysts favour gradualism over aggressive cuts.
Global context
Egypt’s anticipated move comes amid a broader shift in emerging markets, where central banks are cautiously unwinding the steep hikes of the past two years. Brazil, Chile, and Hungary have all entered easing cycles, while Turkey and South Africa are expected to follow suit in late 2025.
At the same time, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have signalled that their tightening cycles are over, with markets pricing in potential rate cuts in early 2026. This global backdrop provides the CBE with some room to manoeuvre, as capital flows into emerging markets remain supportive.
Looking ahead
MPC decision will likely set the tone for monetary policy in the final quarter of 2025. If the CBE opts for a bolder 200-basis-point cut, it could signal an acceleration of the easing cycle. A more cautious 100-basis-point move, however, would suggest gradualism and careful calibration.
Either way, analysts agree that the trajectory is downward, with policy rates expected to decline by at least 300–400 basis points by year-end — provided inflation remains on its current disinflationary path.
The balancing act for Egypt’s policymakers is clear: continue to anchor inflation expectations while providing breathing space for the private sector and supporting growth. The choice between a 1% or 2% cut may be tactical — but the direction of travel is unmistakable.",2025-12-05T11:27:59.637042

According to the CBE’s monthly report, total foreign assets held by the banking system—which includes the central bank and commercial banks—reached EGP 4.366trn in October, up from EGP 4.318trn in September. Foreign liabilities fell slightly to EGP 3.295trn, down from EGP 3.322trn the previous month.
Net foreign assets represent the difference between the banking sector’s foreign-currency assets—such as deposits and securities—and its foreign-currency liabilities. A positive NFA balance indicates that the sector’s foreign-currency holdings exceed its obligations, while a negative balance reflects the opposite.
Egypt’s banking sector slipped into negative NFA territory in February 2022 amid a foreign-currency shortage triggered by the Russia–Ukraine war and global inflationary pressures. It remained negative until May 2024, when the balance returned to surplus following the Wisdom Capital transaction.
Banking expert Mohamed Abdel Aal attributed the recent rise in NFAs to stronger foreign-currency inflows, particularly from remittances, exports and tourism.
He underscored the importance of maintaining growth in net foreign assets, noting that a sustained surplus enhances confidence in the banking system, strengthens its ability to meet domestic and external obligations, and supports the financing needs of corporates, importers and individual customers.

The launch of the committee reflects Egypt’s commitment, through the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade and GAFI, to strengthening its economic partnership with South Korea and resolving challenges facing Korean investors. The platform aims to create a more attractive and stable investment climate through direct dialogue between government institutions and the Korean business community.
During the meeting, Heiba emphasised that cooperation with South Korea is a key pillar of Egypt’s strategy to reinforce economic ties. He highlighted GAFI’s ongoing reforms to streamline procedures, accelerate licensing, and enhance investor services through the digitisation of all investment-related processes.
Heiba noted that GAFI is finalising a unified digital platform that will provide all investor services, including licences, approvals and electronic tracking of applications, designed to improve transparency, efficiency and reduce human intervention. He added that full procedural reengineering, carried out with an international-Egyptian consortium, will begin in January 2026. This includes expanding the “golden licence” system and improving customs clearance to boost the business environment and attract more foreign investment, particularly from South Korea.
Heiba underscored the importance of direct coordination with all relevant government entities to address challenges facing Korean companies in Egypt. He affirmed that GAFI is closely monitoring these issues and developing an executive plan to resolve them, with priority given to eliminating obstacles and ensuring systematic follow-up to support the expansion and sustainability of Korean investments.
For his part, Yi said the meeting reflects the growing mutual interest in advancing economic cooperation. He expressed appreciation for Egypt’s efforts and noted that many Korean companies are successfully operating across key sectors of the Egyptian market. He stressed the importance of addressing investor concerns and fostering a supportive environment for growth and expansion.
GAFI’s Investor Follow-up Department presented recent achievements in aftercare services and outlined executive measures taken to improve the business climate and streamline procedures. The overview reaffirmed the state’s commitment to supporting existing investors and facilitating their growth.
The meeting also featured an open discussion with Korean companies, led by the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA). Participating firms highlighted the key challenges they face in the Egyptian market, while representatives from GAFI, the Central Bank of Egypt, and the Customs and Tax Authorities responded to these concerns and explained available solutions—underscoring the state’s commitment to active engagement and rapid, systematic problem-solving.
Both sides expressed their desire for continued cooperation and regular coordination, agreeing that this constructive dialogue represents an important step toward supporting the business community and facilitating the flow of Korean investments into Egypt in a manner that serves the economic interests of both countries.
The meeting saw broad participation from major Korean companies involved in electronics, electrical industries, TV and mobile phone manufacturing, razor blade production, chemicals, steel, logistics, ready-made garments, power and telecom cables, and packaging materials. Companies operating in nuclear energy, natural resource development, international trade, and railway equipment design and manufacturing also took part, reflecting the depth and diversity of Korean interest in expanding investment cooperation with Egypt.",2025-12-05T11:30:34.117481

During the meeting, Heiba emphasised that cooperation with South Korea is a key pillar of Egypt’s strategy to reinforce economic ties. He highlighted GAFI’s ongoing reforms to streamline procedures, accelerate licensing, and enhance investor services through the digitisation of all investment-related processes.
Heiba noted that GAFI is finalising a unified digital platform that will provide all investor services, including licences, approvals and electronic tracking of applications, designed to improve transparency, efficiency and reduce human intervention. He added that full procedural reengineering, carried out with an international-Egyptian consortium, will begin in January 2026. This includes expanding the “golden licence” system and improving customs clearance to boost the business environment and attract more foreign investment, particularly from South Korea.
Heiba underscored the importance of direct coordination with all relevant government entities to address challenges facing Korean companies in Egypt. He affirmed that GAFI is closely monitoring these issues and developing an executive plan to resolve them, with priority given to eliminating obstacles and ensuring systematic follow-up to support the expansion and sustainability of Korean investments.
For his part, Yi said the meeting reflects the growing mutual interest in advancing economic cooperation. He expressed appreciation for Egypt’s efforts and noted that many Korean companies are successfully operating across key sectors of the Egyptian market. He stressed the importance of addressing investor concerns and fostering a supportive environment for growth and expansion.
GAFI’s Investor Follow-up Department presented recent achievements in aftercare services and outlined executive measures taken to improve the business climate and streamline procedures. The overview reaffirmed the state’s commitment to supporting existing investors and facilitating their growth.
The meeting also featured an open discussion with Korean companies, led by the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA). Participating firms highlighted the key challenges they face in the Egyptian market, while representatives from GAFI, the Central Bank of Egypt, and the Customs and Tax Authorities responded to these concerns and explained available solutions—underscoring the state’s commitment to active engagement and rapid, systematic problem-solving.
Both sides expressed their desire for continued cooperation and regular coordination, agreeing that this constructive dialogue represents an important step toward supporting the business community and facilitating the flow of Korean investments into Egypt in a manner that serves the economic interests of both countries.
The meeting saw broad participation from major Korean companies involved in electronics, electrical industries, TV and mobile phone manufacturing, razor blade production, chemicals, steel, logistics, ready-made garments, power and telecom cables, and packaging materials. Companies operating in nuclear energy, natural resource development, international trade, and railway equipment design and manufacturing also took part, reflecting the depth and diversity of Korean interest in expanding investment cooperation with Egypt.",2025-12-05T11:33:44.800077

"Amazon Egypt expands storage capacity amid rising demand, local manufacturing boom",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/amazon-egypt-expands-storage-capacity-amid-rising-demand-local-manufacturing-boom/,,2025-12-07,,710,0.912598192691803,"Egypt has endured one of the most challenging economic periods in its recent history over the past two years. Surging inflation and sharp exchange-rate volatility have reshaped consumer behaviour, pushing households to prioritise essential goods over discretionary spending. According to Omar Elsahy, General Manager of Amazon Egypt, this shift has been clearly reflected in purchasing trends on Amazon.eg.
“Demand for essential goods, particularly food items and basic household products, has grown tremendously,” Elsahy told Daily News Egypt. “Our priority was to strengthen our presence in these categories to ensure that Egyptian families could access the essentials they rely on every day.”
At the same time, he noted, an unexpected trend has taken hold: a significant rise in the availability and quality of locally manufactured products. Egyptian factories and artisans have increased production across sectors such as apparel, home goods and personal accessories, offering high-quality items at more accessible prices.
“The rise of local manufacturing has been transformative for Egyptian e-commerce,” Elsahy said. “Customers are increasingly choosing local products not just for price, but for quality and uniqueness. Supporting these entrepreneurs is part of Amazon’s DNA, hence our dedicated storefronts and programmes for Egyptian SMEs. When local sellers succeed, customers get better selection, communities flourish, and the digital economy grows stronger. Despite economic challenges, this vibrant seller community has contributed significantly to e-commerce growth over the past three years.”
Elsahy revealed that Amazon’s storage footprint in Egypt has now expanded to more than 100,000 cubic metres. “This includes our main fulfilment centres in 10th of Ramadan and on the Suez Road, supported by several additional operational sites run through local partners.”
One of the newest facilities, he added, offers storage capacity equivalent to ten football fields, underlining Amazon’s long-term investment in Egypt’s digital infrastructure. “These expansions are not a temporary reaction to rising demand. They are part of a forward-looking strategy to prepare for the next three years of growth.”
Much of this strategy is rooted in Egypt’s progress in financial inclusion, logistics development and its advancing digital economy, all critical to enabling faster, more reliable e-commerce operations.
Since Amazon launched in Egypt in 2021, collaboration with government authorities has intensified. Elsahy described it as a “shared vision” aimed at strengthening the digital economy and empowering local manufacturers and sellers.
He noted that the Prime Minister’s meeting with Amazon’s global CEO in April served as a progress review to ensure that expansion plans align with the government’s digital-transformation and financial-inclusion agenda. “Government support has been crucial,” he said. “It facilitated licensing, enhanced the regulatory environment and enabled smoother business operations.”
Amazon has also broadened cooperation with chambers of commerce and SME-support programmes, integrating hundreds of factories and companies into its seller network. As a result, more Egyptian products are reaching wider audiences on Amazon.eg.
Financial solutions have become an increasingly important part of Amazon’s customer offering in Egypt. The company has expanded payment options through strategic partnerships with financial-service providers including Valu and several banks.
“Egyptian customers are looking for flexibility in how they pay, particularly for higher-value purchases,” Elsahy explained. “Our collaborations allow customers to spread payments over time, making more products accessible to more people.” These partnerships have introduced innovative tools, especially during major sale events such as the White Friday Sale—including 0% interest instalments, buy-now-pay-later options and exclusive discounts for specific bank cards.
“Every investment decision we make centres on customer needs,” he emphasised. “We continuously evaluate these collaborations to ensure they help customers get what they need, when they need it, at prices they can afford. That is the lens through which we view all our business decisions.”
Addressing speculation about robots, drones and other futuristic technologies, Elsahy clarified that most of Amazon’s innovation happens behind the scenes. Visible tools—such as warehouse robots or drone delivery—are not what ultimately define service quality. “What truly elevates the customer experience is faster fulfilment, higher accuracy and better availability.”
Despite economic volatility, Elsahy remains optimistic. “Egypt has tremendous potential, with strong customer demand across many categories. We grow thoughtfully, but never before we are ready to deliver a great customer experience.” His closing message reflects Amazon’s global philosophy: “Every decision begins with one question, does it serve the customer?

Surging inflation and sharp exchange-rate volatility have reshaped consumer behaviour, pushing households to prioritise essential goods over discretionary spending. According to Omar Elsahy, General Manager of Amazon Egypt, this shift has been clearly reflected in purchasing trends on Amazon.eg.
“Demand for essential goods, particularly food items and basic household products, has grown tremendously,” Elsahy told Daily News Egypt. “Our priority was to strengthen our presence in these categories to ensure that Egyptian families could access the essentials they rely on every day.”
At the same time, he noted, an unexpected trend has taken hold: a significant rise in the availability and quality of locally manufactured products. Egyptian factories and artisans have increased production across sectors such as apparel, home goods and personal accessories, offering high-quality items at more accessible prices.
“The rise of local manufacturing has been transformative for Egyptian e-commerce,” Elsahy said. “Customers are increasingly choosing local products not just for price, but for quality and uniqueness. Supporting these entrepreneurs is part of Amazon’s DNA, hence our dedicated storefronts and programmes for Egyptian SMEs. When local sellers succeed, customers get better selection, communities flourish, and the digital economy grows stronger. Despite economic challenges, this vibrant seller community has contributed significantly to e-commerce growth over the past three years.”
Elsahy revealed that Amazon’s storage footprint in Egypt has now expanded to more than 100,000 cubic metres. “This includes our main fulfilment centres in 10th of Ramadan and on the Suez Road, supported by several additional operational sites run through local partners.”
One of the newest facilities, he added, offers storage capacity equivalent to ten football fields, underlining Amazon’s long-term investment in Egypt’s digital infrastructure. “These expansions are not a temporary reaction to rising demand. They are part of a forward-looking strategy to prepare for the next three years of growth.”
Much of this strategy is rooted in Egypt’s progress in financial inclusion, logistics development and its advancing digital economy, all critical to enabling faster, more reliable e-commerce operations.
Since Amazon launched in Egypt in 2021, collaboration with government authorities has intensified. Elsahy described it as a “shared vision” aimed at strengthening the digital economy and empowering local manufacturers and sellers.
He noted that the Prime Minister’s meeting with Amazon’s global CEO in April served as a progress review to ensure that expansion plans align with the government’s digital-transformation and financial-inclusion agenda. “Government support has been crucial,” he said. “It facilitated licensing, enhanced the regulatory environment and enabled smoother business operations.”
Amazon has also broadened cooperation with chambers of commerce and SME-support programmes, integrating hundreds of factories and companies into its seller network. As a result, more Egyptian products are reaching wider audiences on Amazon.eg.
Financial solutions have become an increasingly important part of Amazon’s customer offering in Egypt. The company has expanded payment options through strategic partnerships with financial-service providers including Valu and several banks.
“Egyptian customers are looking for flexibility in how they pay, particularly for higher-value purchases,” Elsahy explained. “Our collaborations allow customers to spread payments over time, making more products accessible to more people.” These partnerships have introduced innovative tools, especially during major sale events such as the White Friday Sale—including 0% interest instalments, buy-now-pay-later options and exclusive discounts for specific bank cards.
“Every investment decision we make centres on customer needs,” he emphasised. “We continuously evaluate these collaborations to ensure they help customers get what they need, when they need it, at prices they can afford. That is the lens through which we view all our business decisions.”
Addressing speculation about robots, drones and other futuristic technologies, Elsahy clarified that most of Amazon’s innovation happens behind the scenes. Visible tools—such as warehouse robots or drone delivery—are not what ultimately define service quality. “What truly elevates the customer experience is faster fulfilment, higher accuracy and better availability.”
Despite economic volatility, Elsahy remains optimistic. “Egypt has tremendous potential, with strong customer demand across many categories. We grow thoughtfully, but never before we are ready to deliver a great customer experience.” His closing message reflects Amazon’s global philosophy: “Every decision begins with one question, does it serve the customer? If the answer is yes, we move. If not, we wait.”",2025-12-08T09:30:51.749614

GAFI launches guideline for cash investment Incentive to support industrial projects,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/gafi-launches-guideline-for-cash-investment-incentive-to-support-industrial-projects/,,2025-12-07,,390,0.0,"Hossam Heiba, CEO of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI), announced the release of the official guideline for the new cash investment incentive dedicated to industrial projects. The initiative reflects the government’s commitment to transparency, clarity, streamlined procedures, and accessible information for investors.
Heiba confirmed that the guideline is now available to all investors and can be accessed via the email link:
[email protected]
. He added that the committee responsible for administering the incentive has begun receiving applications through the same channel.
According to Heiba, the incentive represents one of the most significant mechanisms for attracting foreign direct investment, as it provides eligible investors with a direct cash payment disbursed after taxes are paid. The value of the incentive is linked to the volume of foreign financing allocated to the project, which must account for at least 50% of the project’s total capital. In addition, eligible projects must ensure that industrial products listed in the schedule attached to the Cabinet decision represent no less than 50% of their annual turnover.
GAFI previously issued Decision No. 675 of 2025 establishing the committee tasked with granting the cash investment incentive for industrial projects. The committee is chaired by a GAFI representative and includes members from the Industrial Development Authority, the Industrial Modernisation Centre, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Central Bank of Egypt, and the Egyptian Tax Authority.
The committee’s responsibilities include assessing applications, issuing decisions, granting eligibility certificates, providing annual approvals for incentive disbursement, and issuing preliminary approvals in accordance with Cabinet Decision No. 77 of 2023.
Heiba noted that, consistent with the state’s strategy to support the industrial sector, localize manufacturing, and enhance the competitiveness of Egyptian products as a driver of economic growth, Law No. 160 of 2023 was enacted to amend certain provisions of the Investment Law. The amendment added Article 11 (bis), which provides industrial investment projects with a cash incentive without affecting other incentives already granted by the law. Cabinet Decision No. 77 of 2023 further defined the requirements, controls, and criteria for implementing the incentive—from eligibility conditions and classifications to disbursement and oversight mechanisms.
The decision also allows industrial projects to obtain a preliminary approval valid for three years, giving investors added assurance that they will receive the incentive even if regulatory changes occur during the implementation period.",2025-12-08T09:31:40.985575
"Egyptian senator proposes unified digital, regulatory framework to organise property market",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/egyptian-senator-proposes-unified-digital-regulatory-framework-to-organise-property-market/,,2025-12-07,,632,0.0,"Deputy Leader of the Wafd Party bloc in the Egyptian Senate, Yasser Qoura, has submitted the first “proposal by request” to the Senate’s housing committee during the second legislative term, outlining a comprehensive plan to better regulate Egypt’s real estate market.
Qoura said the proposal is centred on establishing a unified digital, financial and regulatory system designed to enhance transparency, ensure fairness and strengthen market discipline. The initiative aligns with the state’s digital transformation agenda and efforts to improve the investment climate.
The framework, titled the “Real Estate Regulatory Unit,” aims to create a permanent system to oversee the sector, protect the rights of buyers and investors, and curb market manipulation and unregulated practices. Qoura said the plan would help stabilise the property market, improve project execution, eliminate “illusory property sales,” and position real estate as a driver of sustainable economic growth.
He stressed that the proposal’s core objective is to safeguard investors’ funds, protect buyers’ rights, and establish a fair legal structure that also supports developers and promotes overall market stability. Qoura added that, despite the sector’s strategic economic importance, particularly for Egyptians at home and abroad, as well as Arab and Gulf investors, Egypt still lacks a comprehensive law governing real estate transactions.
Under the proposal, a national real estate authority would be established to regulate the market and supervise projects. Each project would be required to operate a mandatory escrow account into which all customer payments and financing would be deposited. Disbursement to developers would be tied to verified construction progress, monitored by a general consultant and the proposed authority, to ensure timely and compliant project delivery.
The system, Qoura noted, is designed to benefit both buyers and developers. Buyers’ funds would be protected, while developers would be shielded from risks arising from unforeseen economic shocks such as currency devaluation. Compensation would be limited to actual cost differences without additional profit margins, helping ensure projects are completed even under challenging conditions.
The proposal also calls for unifying sales contracts across real estate companies, requiring standardised and transparent data on unit areas, pricing, services and facilities. This measure aims to reduce price disparities and curb unfair practices across the sector.
Drawing on international models tailored to Egypt’s market, the draft incorporates elements from the regulatory experiences of the UAE, Saudi Arabia and the United States, adapted to local circumstances.
Key features include the creation of a national coordinating body composed of representatives from the Ministries of Housing, Justice and Finance, as well as the Central Bank of Egypt, to oversee projects and regulate relationships between developers, buyers and financiers.
The plan also proposes launching a unified digital monitoring platform providing a comprehensive database of all projects, developers, actual prices and construction progress. Linked to banks, financing institutions and the New Urban Communities Authority, the platform would enhance transparency and enable real-time oversight.
To speed up dispute resolution, the proposal recommends establishing a specialised judicial unit comprising judges, legal advisers and engineering experts to handle real estate disputes efficiently, avoiding delays associated with traditional civil courts.
Additional measures include requiring developers to issue a digital unit identification certificate detailing the approved area, true price per square metre, project registration number and the project’s dedicated bank account. The draft also bans vague or misleading terminology in sales contracts.
The proposal seeks to attract foreign investment through tax and administrative incentives for environmentally compliant developers, simplified registration procedures for foreign buyers and strengthened international marketing of Egyptian real estate through embassies and diplomatic missions.
Post-delivery management is also addressed through provisions for dedicated maintenance accounts, with maintenance deposits transferred to homeowners’ associations to ensure service sustainability.
The proposal will now be examined by the relevant Senate committees before being referred to the House of Representatives and subsequently to the government for further consideration.",2025-12-08T09:32:06.608947
Egyptian developers offer unprecedented cash discounts amid mounting market pressures,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/egyptian-developers-offer-unprecedented-cash-discounts-amid-mounting-market-pressures/,,2025-12-07,,593,0.8838165998458862,"“It is impossible for residential unit prices to drop, unlike cars,” said Osama Saad, CEO of the Real Estate Development Chamber, as developers grapple with rising costs and shifting market conditions.
Saad explained that recent fluctuations in the exchange rate and construction material prices prompted a series of meetings with developers to explore potential price reductions. However, it was agreed that unit prices in projects where one or two phases have already been sold will remain unchanged. Instead, developers are offering additional in-kind benefits, such as upgraded finishing packages or contributions toward club memberships, to attract buyers without altering base prices.
In recent months, the market has seen cash payment discounts exceeding 50%, an unprecedented level for Egypt’s real estate sector. Several developers have introduced these aggressive offers to boost liquidity and maintain construction momentum amid rising costs and tightening financing conditions. Traditionally, cash discounts have ranged from 25% to 30%, but recent pressures have pushed them significantly higher.
In East Cairo, particularly the New Administrative Capital, Mostakbal City, and the Fifth Settlement, cash discounts ranged between 25% and 50%. In West Cairo, projects recorded discounts of around 30%. Madinet Masr stood out by offering what marketers say is the highest announced cash discount so far: 55% for immediate full payments.
Abdallah Sallam, President and CEO of Madinet Masr, said the company’s offers reflect current purchasing power and evolving customer preferences. Madinet Masr, he explained, continuously designs flexible payment plans tailored to diverse client segments. The current discount levels, he noted, align with prevailing interest rates and offer buyers a balanced financial alternative.
Sallam emphasised that upfront-payment incentives aim to stimulate demand and provide practical solutions in the current economic environment. These offers help companies reinforce cash flow, supporting construction and operational commitments. He added that such approaches bolster the appeal of real estate as a stable investment while ensuring Madinet Masr’s long-term financial and operational resilience.
However, not all industry voices are optimistic. Mohamed Samir, CEO of Elite Consulting, said the steep cash discounts signal mounting pressures in the market. He warned that the sector faces a “real crisis” that could intensify in the first and second quarters of 2026 due to liquidity shortages, slowing sales, and rising rates of unit returns.
Samir noted that Egypt lacks a robust mortgage financing system capable of supporting demand, leaving developers dependent on cash discounts to secure liquidity. Much of this cash, he added, is directed toward covering immediate financial obligations and completing ongoing projects. Access to bank financing remains limited, available only to a small number of large developers and often requiring lengthy processing times, which weakens financial sustainability across the sector.
He highlighted that 2022 and 2023 witnessed a surge in new project launches and strong sales, with many units scheduled for delivery in 2026. But current liquidity constraints and slowing sales could affect delivery timelines and challenge some developers’ ability to meet obligations to clients.
Abd Elrahman Abozeid, Senior Sales Team Leader at Taskeen, a subsidiary of Nawy specialising in proptech solutions, said the large cash discounts have generated “noticeable movement” in the real estate market in recent months. He noted that the offers have boosted demand for ready units and projects nearing completion. While upfront-payment discounts in such projects typically remain below 50%, they tend to increase as construction advances.
Abozeid added that the primary objective of these offers is to stimulate sales and secure the cash flow required to complete projects. Discount levels, he said, vary based on the size of the upfront payment and the conditions of each project.",2025-12-08T09:32:12.399785
Egypt’s net international reserves rise to $50.215bn in November,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/egypts-net-international-reserves-rise-to-50-215bn-in-november/,,2025-12-07,,335,-0.9101063013076782,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) announced that the country’s net international reserves increased to $50.215bn in November 2025, up from $50.071bn in October, a rise of $144.4m.
The CBE noted that gold holdings within the reserves climbed to $17.252bn in November, compared to $16.545bn the previous month, marking an increase of $798m. Meanwhile, the value of foreign currencies in the reserves declined to $32.905bn, down from $33.350bn in October, a drop of $445m. Holdings of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) also fell to $61m, from $179m, reflecting a decrease of $118m.
Egypt’s foreign exchange reserves comprise a basket of major international currencies, including the US dollar, euro, pound sterling, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. The allocation of these holdings is determined by exchange-rate movements and the relative stability of each currency in global markets, and is adjusted according to a strategy set by CBE officials.
The primary role of the reserves, made up of gold and foreign currencies, is to secure essential imports, meet external debt obligations, and provide a buffer during economic shocks, particularly when foreign-currency-generating sectors come under pressure.
Global ratings agency Fitch has projected that Egypt’s reserves will reach $52.6bn by the end of the current fiscal year, after hitting a record $50.1bn in October.
In a recent report, Fitch noted a significant uptick in portfolio investment since last August, driven by attractive yields, which has supported the pound’s improved performance against the US dollar. The agency expects the pound to maintain its strong trajectory into 2026, highlighting that net foreign assets in the banking sector reached their highest level since February 2020 as of October 2025.
While Fitch anticipates further interest-rate cuts by the CBE in the coming months, it said Egyptian bond yields are likely to remain appealing to investors.
“The improvement in the external sector will persist,” the agency added. “The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 3% of GDP in 2025/2026, supported by higher exports of goods and services and robust remittances from Egyptians working abroad.”",2025-12-08T09:32:48.032560

"Egyptian senator proposes unified digital, regulatory framework to organise property market",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/egyptian-senator-proposes-unified-digital-regulatory-framework-to-organise-property-market/,,2025-12-07,,632,0.0,"Deputy Leader of the Wafd Party bloc in the Egyptian Senate, Yasser Qoura, has submitted the first “proposal by request” to the Senate’s housing committee during the second legislative term, outlining a comprehensive plan to better regulate Egypt’s real estate market.
Qoura said the proposal is centred on establishing a unified digital, financial and regulatory system designed to enhance transparency, ensure fairness and strengthen market discipline. The initiative aligns with the state’s digital transformation agenda and efforts to improve the investment climate.
The framework, titled the “Real Estate Regulatory Unit,” aims to create a permanent system to oversee the sector, protect the rights of buyers and investors, and curb market manipulation and unregulated practices. Qoura said the plan would help stabilise the property market, improve project execution, eliminate “illusory property sales,” and position real estate as a driver of sustainable economic growth.
He stressed that the proposal’s core objective is to safeguard investors’ funds, protect buyers’ rights, and establish a fair legal structure that also supports developers and promotes overall market stability. Qoura added that, despite the sector’s strategic economic importance, particularly for Egyptians at home and abroad, as well as Arab and Gulf investors, Egypt still lacks a comprehensive law governing real estate transactions.
Under the proposal, a national real estate authority would be established to regulate the market and supervise projects. Each project would be required to operate a mandatory escrow account into which all customer payments and financing would be deposited. Disbursement to developers would be tied to verified construction progress, monitored by a general consultant and the proposed authority, to ensure timely and compliant project delivery.
The system, Qoura noted, is designed to benefit both buyers and developers. Buyers’ funds would be protected, while developers would be shielded from risks arising from unforeseen economic shocks such as currency devaluation. Compensation would be limited to actual cost differences without additional profit margins, helping ensure projects are completed even under challenging conditions.
The proposal also calls for unifying sales contracts across real estate companies, requiring standardised and transparent data on unit areas, pricing, services and facilities. This measure aims to reduce price disparities and curb unfair practices across the sector.
Drawing on international models tailored to Egypt’s market, the draft incorporates elements from the regulatory experiences of the UAE, Saudi Arabia and the United States, adapted to local circumstances.
Key features include the creation of a national coordinating body composed of representatives from the Ministries of Housing, Justice and Finance, as well as the Central Bank of Egypt, to oversee projects and regulate relationships between developers, buyers and financiers.
The plan also proposes launching a unified digital monitoring platform providing a comprehensive database of all projects, developers, actual prices and construction progress. Linked to banks, financing institutions and the New Urban Communities Authority, the platform would enhance transparency and enable real-time oversight.
To speed up dispute resolution, the proposal recommends establishing a specialised judicial unit comprising judges, legal advisers and engineering experts to handle real estate disputes efficiently, avoiding delays associated with traditional civil courts.
Additional measures include requiring developers to issue a digital unit identification certificate detailing the approved area, true price per square metre, project registration number and the project’s dedicated bank account. The draft also bans vague or misleading terminology in sales contracts.
The proposal seeks to attract foreign investment through tax and administrative incentives for environmentally compliant developers, simplified registration procedures for foreign buyers and strengthened international marketing of Egyptian real estate through embassies and diplomatic missions.
Post-delivery management is also addressed through provisions for dedicated maintenance accounts, with maintenance deposits transferred to homeowners’ associations to ensure service sustainability.
The proposal will now be examined by the relevant Senate committees before being referred to the House of Representatives and subsequently to the government for further consideration.",2025-12-08T09:35:15.679237
Egyptian developers offer unprecedented cash discounts amid mounting market pressures,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/egyptian-developers-offer-unprecedented-cash-discounts-amid-mounting-market-pressures/,,2025-12-07,,593,0.8838165998458862,"“It is impossible for residential unit prices to drop, unlike cars,” said Osama Saad, CEO of the Real Estate Development Chamber, as developers grapple with rising costs and shifting market conditions.
Saad explained that recent fluctuations in the exchange rate and construction material prices prompted a series of meetings with developers to explore potential price reductions. However, it was agreed that unit prices in projects where one or two phases have already been sold will remain unchanged. Instead, developers are offering additional in-kind benefits, such as upgraded finishing packages or contributions toward club memberships, to attract buyers without altering base prices.
In recent months, the market has seen cash payment discounts exceeding 50%, an unprecedented level for Egypt’s real estate sector. Several developers have introduced these aggressive offers to boost liquidity and maintain construction momentum amid rising costs and tightening financing conditions. Traditionally, cash discounts have ranged from 25% to 30%, but recent pressures have pushed them significantly higher.
In East Cairo, particularly the New Administrative Capital, Mostakbal City, and the Fifth Settlement, cash discounts ranged between 25% and 50%. In West Cairo, projects recorded discounts of around 30%. Madinet Masr stood out by offering what marketers say is the highest announced cash discount so far: 55% for immediate full payments.
Abdallah Sallam, President and CEO of Madinet Masr, said the company’s offers reflect current purchasing power and evolving customer preferences. Madinet Masr, he explained, continuously designs flexible payment plans tailored to diverse client segments. The current discount levels, he noted, align with prevailing interest rates and offer buyers a balanced financial alternative.
Sallam emphasised that upfront-payment incentives aim to stimulate demand and provide practical solutions in the current economic environment. These offers help companies reinforce cash flow, supporting construction and operational commitments. He added that such approaches bolster the appeal of real estate as a stable investment while ensuring Madinet Masr’s long-term financial and operational resilience.
However, not all industry voices are optimistic. Mohamed Samir, CEO of Elite Consulting, said the steep cash discounts signal mounting pressures in the market. He warned that the sector faces a “real crisis” that could intensify in the first and second quarters of 2026 due to liquidity shortages, slowing sales, and rising rates of unit returns.
Samir noted that Egypt lacks a robust mortgage financing system capable of supporting demand, leaving developers dependent on cash discounts to secure liquidity. Much of this cash, he added, is directed toward covering immediate financial obligations and completing ongoing projects. Access to bank financing remains limited, available only to a small number of large developers and often requiring lengthy processing times, which weakens financial sustainability across the sector.
He highlighted that 2022 and 2023 witnessed a surge in new project launches and strong sales, with many units scheduled for delivery in 2026. But current liquidity constraints and slowing sales could affect delivery timelines and challenge some developers’ ability to meet obligations to clients.
Abd Elrahman Abozeid, Senior Sales Team Leader at Taskeen, a subsidiary of Nawy specialising in proptech solutions, said the large cash discounts have generated “noticeable movement” in the real estate market in recent months. He noted that the offers have boosted demand for ready units and projects nearing completion. While upfront-payment discounts in such projects typically remain below 50%, they tend to increase as construction advances.
Abozeid added that the primary objective of these offers is to stimulate sales and secure the cash flow required to complete projects. Discount levels, he said, vary based on the size of the upfront payment and the conditions of each project.",2025-12-08T09:35:21.389874
Egypt’s net international reserves rise to $50.215bn in November,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/egypts-net-international-reserves-rise-to-50-215bn-in-november/,,2025-12-07,,335,-0.9101063013076782,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) announced that the country’s net international reserves increased to $50.215bn in November 2025, up from $50.071bn in October, a rise of $144.4m.
The CBE noted that gold holdings within the reserves climbed to $17.252bn in November, compared to $16.545bn the previous month, marking an increase of $798m. Meanwhile, the value of foreign currencies in the reserves declined to $32.905bn, down from $33.350bn in October, a drop of $445m. Holdings of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) also fell to $61m, from $179m, reflecting a decrease of $118m.
Egypt’s foreign exchange reserves comprise a basket of major international currencies, including the US dollar, euro, pound sterling, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. The allocation of these holdings is determined by exchange-rate movements and the relative stability of each currency in global markets, and is adjusted according to a strategy set by CBE officials.
The primary role of the reserves, made up of gold and foreign currencies, is to secure essential imports, meet external debt obligations, and provide a buffer during economic shocks, particularly when foreign-currency-generating sectors come under pressure.
Global ratings agency Fitch has projected that Egypt’s reserves will reach $52.6bn by the end of the current fiscal year, after hitting a record $50.1bn in October.
In a recent report, Fitch noted a significant uptick in portfolio investment since last August, driven by attractive yields, which has supported the pound’s improved performance against the US dollar. The agency expects the pound to maintain its strong trajectory into 2026, highlighting that net foreign assets in the banking sector reached their highest level since February 2020 as of October 2025.
While Fitch anticipates further interest-rate cuts by the CBE in the coming months, it said Egyptian bond yields are likely to remain appealing to investors.
“The improvement in the external sector will persist,” the agency added. “The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 3% of GDP in 2025/2026, supported by higher exports of goods and services and robust remittances from Egyptians working abroad.”",2025-12-08T09:35:55.533832
