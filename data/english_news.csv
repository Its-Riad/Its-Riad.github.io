2025-12-07,Egypt’s net international reserves rise to $50.215bn in November,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/egypts-net-international-reserves-rise-to-50-215bn-in-november/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) announced that the country’s net international reserves increased to $50.215bn in November 2025, up from $50.071bn in October, a rise of $144.4m.
The CBE noted that gold holdings within the reserves climbed to $17.252bn in November, compared to $16.545bn the previous month, marking an increase of $798m. Meanwhile, the value of foreign currencies in the reserves declined to $32.905bn, down from $33.350bn in October, a drop of $445m. Holdings of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) also fell to $61m, from $179m, reflecting a decrease of $118m.
Egypt’s foreign exchange reserves comprise a basket of major international currencies, including the US dollar, euro, pound sterling, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. The allocation of these holdings is determined by exchange-rate movements and the relative stability of each currency in global markets, and is adjusted according to a strategy set by CBE officials.
The primary role of the reserves, made up of gold and foreign currencies, is to secure essential imports, meet external debt obligations, and provide a buffer during economic shocks, particularly when foreign-currency-generating sectors come under pressure.
Global ratings agency Fitch has projected that Egypt’s reserves will reach $52.6bn by the end of the current fiscal year, after hitting a record $50.1bn in October.
In a recent report, Fitch noted a significant uptick in portfolio investment since last August, driven by attractive yields, which has supported the pound’s improved performance against the US dollar. The agency expects the pound to maintain its strong trajectory into 2026, highlighting that net foreign assets in the banking sector reached their highest level since February 2020 as of October 2025.
While Fitch anticipates further interest-rate cuts by the CBE in the coming months, it said Egyptian bond yields are likely to remain appealing to investors.
“The improvement in the external sector will persist,” the agency added. “The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 3% of GDP in 2025/2026, supported by higher exports of goods and services and robust remittances from Egyptians working abroad.”",335,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9101063013076782,2025-12-08T21:28:39.786158
2025-12-08,"Egypt, France discuss ways to advance investment cooperation, streamline customs procedures",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/08/egypt-france-discuss-ways-to-advance-investment-cooperation-streamline-customs-procedures/,"The General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) held an expanded meeting with French Ambassador to Egypt Éric Chevallier and Egyptian Customs Authority Chairperson Ahmed Amoui, bringing together senior French officials and representatives of French companies operating in the Egyptian market to discuss ways to strengthen investment cooperation and improve the business environment.
The meeting included the participation of Pascal Forêt, Head of the Economic Department at the French Embassy in Cairo; Christelle Labernède, Country Director of Business France in Egypt; Laurent Pasquier, Regional Customs Attaché; and Mohamed Saad, Head of the Egypt branch of French Foreign Trade Advisors.
The discussions come within the framework of Egypt’s efforts to enhance the investment climate, modernise its regulatory environment, and attract further foreign direct investment.
Hossam Heiba, CEO of GAFI, underscored the important role of French investments in supporting Egypt’s economic growth, highlighting the continued expansion and diversification of French companies across the industrial and service sectors. Heiba noted that the government is implementing wide-ranging reforms to modernise the customs system, including accelerating pre-clearance procedures, expanding digital platforms, improving valuation methods, and reducing release times—measures that strengthen Egypt’s competitiveness and facilitate trade flows.
He emphasised that French investors can benefit from GAFI’s Permanent Unit for Investor Problem-Solving and the Investor Dispute Resolution Centre, which provide swift and effective mechanisms to address challenges and stabilise investment activities. Heiba added that the meeting marks the start of a regular dialogue platform between GAFI, the French Embassy, and French companies to discuss constraints and enhance the overall business environment.
For his part, Ambassador Chevallier reiterated France’s commitment to advancing economic and investment cooperation with Egypt, stressing that French companies are longstanding partners in supporting the Egyptian economy and expanding opportunities across multiple sectors. He added that periodic meetings between both sides provide an important avenue for exchanging expertise, addressing bottlenecks, and streamlining procedures for French investors.
Customs Authority Chairperson Ahmed Amoui presented the key customs reforms underway, particularly in simplifying procedures, expanding digital infrastructure, and accelerating trade flows in line with international best practices, ultimately improving services provided to investors.
A dedicated discussion session followed, during which representatives of French companies raised customs-related challenges and supply-chain issues, and explored opportunities to support the expansion and stability of French investments in Egypt. Participating companies included leading players in the automotive, energy, food, logistics, biotechnology, aviation, sports, and hospitality sectors, among them Valeo, Air Liquide, Bel, CMA CGM, bioMérieux, Dassault, SCAT, Decathlon, and Groupe Barrière.
Both sides concluded the meeting by expressing their commitment to continued coordination and joint work, affirming that constructive dialogue between Egyptian government institutions and French businesses is vital to supporting the investment community, facilitating smoother procedures, and strengthening economic ties between Egypt and France.",453,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7004396915435791,2025-12-08T21:29:08.690819

, although
the police force remains the sector perceived as most corrupt, a Transparency International Pakistan survey showed on Tuesday.
The National Corruption Perception Survey (
NCPS
) 2025 indicated that nearly 60% of respondents fully or partially agreed that the government had successfully stabilised the economy through its International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and by exiting the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list.
Furthermore, 66% of respondents stated they did not encounter a situation in the last 12 months where they felt compelled to pay a bribe to access public services.
Methodology and Scope
The survey, conducted from Sept. 22 to Sept. 29, 2025, expanded its sample size to 4,000 respondents across 20 districts. The exercise included urban and rural populations, persons with disabilities, and transgender persons to provide a more representative snapshot of public sentiment.
Transparency International Pakistan noted that the NCPS measures public “mood” and experiences rather than certifying actual corruption levels or investigating specific cases. As a domestic exercise, the findings do not alter Pakistan’s standing on the global Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI).
Sector Rankings and Improvements
While the police sector remained the
highest ranked
for perceived corruption at 24%,
the
figure reflected a 6% improvement in public perception
regarding
behaviour and service delivery.
Other institutions showing improved public perception included education, land and property, local government, and taxation.
Following the police, tendering and procurement ranked second at 16%, while the judiciary placed third at 14%.
Despite the acknowledgement of macroeconomic stabilisation, 57% of respondents reported that their purchasing power had decreased over the past year.
Institutional Reform and Accountability
The report highlighted a strong public demand for reform within oversight bodies. An overwhelming 78% of Pakistanis said anti-corruption institutions, such as the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), should themselves be answerable and transparent.
Respondents prioritised better accountability (26%), limiting discretionary powers (23%), and stronger Right to Information laws (20%) as the most effective measures to curb corruption.
“The NCPS 2025… highlights how people perceive and experience [corruption] in their daily interactions with public institutions,” said Justice (R) Zia Perwez, Chairman of Transparency International Pakistan.
Health and Political Finance
In the healthcare sector, Pakistanis outlined a blueprint for reform, favouring stricter controls on commissions paid by pharmaceutical companies to doctors (23%) and a ban on private practice by public sector doctors (20%).
Regarding political finance, a combined 83% of respondents supported either banning or strictly regulating business funding to political parties. Additionally, 55% supported a complete ban on the use of political parties’ names and leadership images in government advertisements.
The survey also found that 42% of Pakistanis would feel safe reporting corruption if strong whistleblower protection laws were in place, emphasising the need for anonymity and reward mechanisms.",479,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.5862776041030884,2025-12-08T21:29:14.016829

Korea hold meeting to tackle investment challenges, deepen economic cooperation",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/01/egypt-s-korea-hold-meeting-to-tackle-investment-challenges-deepen-economic-cooperation/,"Egypt’s General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) convened the inaugural meeting of the Egyptian-Korean Business and Investment Development Committee, with the participation of GAFI CEO Hossam Heiba and Hyundo Yi, Commercial Attaché at the South Korean Embassy in Cairo, alongside representatives from several Egyptian government bodies and major Korean companies operating in the country.
The launch of the committee reflects Egypt’s commitment, through the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade and GAFI, to strengthening its economic partnership with South Korea and resolving challenges facing Korean investors. The platform aims to create a more attractive and stable investment climate through direct dialogue between government institutions and the Korean business community.
During the meeting, Heiba emphasised that cooperation with South Korea is a key pillar of Egypt’s strategy to reinforce economic ties. He highlighted GAFI’s ongoing reforms to streamline procedures, accelerate licensing, and enhance investor services through the digitisation of all investment-related processes.
Heiba noted that GAFI is finalising a unified digital platform that will provide all investor services, including licences, approvals and electronic tracking of applications, designed to improve transparency, efficiency and reduce human intervention. He added that full procedural reengineering, carried out with an international-Egyptian consortium, will begin in January 2026. This includes expanding the “golden licence” system and improving customs clearance to boost the business environment and attract more foreign investment, particularly from South Korea.
Heiba underscored the importance of direct coordination with all relevant government entities to address challenges facing Korean companies in Egypt. He affirmed that GAFI is closely monitoring these issues and developing an executive plan to resolve them, with priority given to eliminating obstacles and ensuring systematic follow-up to support the expansion and sustainability of Korean investments.
For his part, Yi said the meeting reflects the growing mutual interest in advancing economic cooperation. He expressed appreciation for Egypt’s efforts and noted that many Korean companies are successfully operating across key sectors of the Egyptian market. He stressed the importance of addressing investor concerns and fostering a supportive environment for growth and expansion.
GAFI’s Investor Follow-up Department presented recent achievements in aftercare services and outlined executive measures taken to improve the business climate and streamline procedures. The overview reaffirmed the state’s commitment to supporting existing investors and facilitating their growth.
The meeting also featured an open discussion with Korean companies, led by the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA). Participating firms highlighted the key challenges they face in the Egyptian market, while representatives from GAFI, the Central Bank of Egypt, and the Customs and Tax Authorities responded to these concerns and explained available solutions—underscoring the state’s commitment to active engagement and rapid, systematic problem-solving.
Both sides expressed their desire for continued cooperation and regular coordination, agreeing that this constructive dialogue represents an important step toward supporting the business community and facilitating the flow of Korean investments into Egypt in a manner that serves the economic interests of both countries.
The meeting saw broad participation from major Korean companies involved in electronics, electrical industries, TV and mobile phone manufacturing, razor blade production, chemicals, steel, logistics, ready-made garments, power and telecom cables, and packaging materials. Companies operating in nuclear energy, natural resource development, international trade, and railway equipment design and manufacturing also took part, reflecting the depth and diversity of Korean interest in expanding investment cooperation with Egypt.",551,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8331554532051086,2025-12-08T21:29:19.229975
2025-08-30,CBE projects inflation to ease to 14–15% in 2025,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/08/30/cbe-projects-inflation-to-ease-to-14-15-in-2025/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) expects headline inflation to decline to between 14% and 15% in 2025, after slowing to 15.2% in the second quarter compared with 16.5% in the first. The projection was announced following the latest meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which cut key interest rates by two percentage points in a move intended to support the disinflationary trend.
The overnight deposit rate was lowered to 22%, the overnight lending rate to 23%, while both the main operation rate and the credit and discount rate were set at 22.5%. The MPC explained that the decision reflected its assessment of recent inflation developments and expectations, building on signs of easing pressures across the domestic economy.
Globally, recent months have seen a gradual recovery in growth alongside stabilising inflation expectations. This has encouraged central banks in advanced and emerging markets to ease monetary policy, albeit cautiously, given continuing uncertainty. Commodity markets remain mixed, with oil prices fluctuating due to supply dynamics, while agricultural prices have followed divergent paths. Despite these developments, risks to global growth and inflation persist, particularly from geopolitical tensions and disruptions to trade policy.
Domestically, preliminary CBE data suggest stronger-than-expected economic growth in the second quarter of 2025, supported mainly by non-oil manufacturing and tourism. Real GDP is now projected to expand by 5.4% in the quarter, with the fiscal year 2024/2025 expected to record average growth of 4.5%, compared with 2.4% in 2023/2024. Labour market conditions also improved, with unemployment falling to 6.1% in the second quarter, down from 6.3% in the first.
Inflation data show further signs of relief. Annual headline inflation slowed to 13.9% in July 2025, from 14.9% in June, while core inflation was broadly stable at 11.6% compared with 11.4% a month earlier. On a monthly basis, both headline and core inflation recorded negative rates in July, at -0.5% and -0.3% respectively, marking a second consecutive month of contraction. These negative monthly readings underline the easing of inflationary pressures and point to improved expectations, supported by monetary policy and more stable exchange rate conditions.
The CBE therefore expects inflation to average between 14% and 15% over the course of 2025, before gradually approaching its target range. According to the outlook, inflation is forecast to converge towards the CBE’s target of 7% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2026, and further towards 5% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2028.
Nevertheless, the MPC cautioned that the inflation path remains exposed to several upside risks. Chief among these are the possibility of administered price adjustments exceeding expectations, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions that could disrupt global supply chains and commodity markets.
Against this backdrop, the Committee judged that cutting policy rates by 200 basis points was appropriate to maintain a monetary stance that anchors expectations and supports the anticipated decline in inflation. The MPC stressed that future policy decisions will continue to be data-dependent, taken on a meeting-by-meeting basis, and guided by inflation expectations, risk assessments, and domestic and external developments.
The Committee reaffirmed its commitment to closely monitor economic and financial conditions and to deploy all available instruments to safeguard price stability.",523,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9495778679847717,2025-12-08T21:29:29.355972

2025-11-22,CBE outlines drivers behind October’s rise in inflation,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/22/cbe-outlines-drivers-behind-octobers-rise-in-inflation/,"Annual urban headline inflation accelerated to 12.5% in October 2025, up from 11.7% in September, according to data released by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE).
The CBE said the acceleration was primarily driven by higher services prices, especially imputed residential rents, in addition to an uptick in volatile food prices.
Non-food inflation rose to 20.4% in October, compared with 19.1% in September, while annual food inflation edged up slightly to 1.5%, from 1.4% a month earlier.
Annual core inflation also accelerated, reaching 12.1% in October 2025 from 11.3% in September. On a monthly basis, core inflation stood at 2% in October, compared with 1.3% in the same month last year.
The CBE noted that the October increase was mainly driven by a pickup in services inflation, led by a sharp 17.5% rise in imputed rents for housing.
Monthly urban headline inflation rose to 1.8% in October 2025, compared with 1.1% in October 2024. The monthly increase was largely attributable to higher prices of fresh vegetables and services, with retail goods also contributing to a lesser extent.
In rural areas, annual headline inflation decelerated to 7.8% in October, from 8.9% in September. Nationwide, annual headline inflation remained broadly stable at 10.1%, compared with 10.3% a month earlier.
Monthly food inflation reached 1.2% in October, contributing 0.5% to monthly headline inflation.
October’s food inflation was driven by:
A 5% increase in volatile food items, adding 0.32% to monthly headline inflation. While fresh fruit prices fell by 7.6%, fresh vegetables surged by 14.7%, both in line with typical seasonal patterns.
A 5% rise in egg prices, contributing 0.08%.
Monthly non-food inflation recorded 2.2% in October, contributing 1.38% to monthly headline inflation.
The CBE said the rise in non-food inflation was mainly due to:
A 4.5% increase in services prices, adding 1.25% to monthly headline inflation. This was largely driven by the 17.5% rise in imputed housing rents, which alone contributed 1.18%, alongside a slight increase in restaurant and café prices.
A 0.5% increase in retail items, contributing 0.07%, mainly due to slightly higher prices for clothing and footwear, cleaning products, and personal care items.
A 0.2% rise in regulated prices, contributing 0.05%, reflecting a 0.5% increase in tobacco prices and a 0.6% rise in LPG cylinder prices.
Monthly core inflation stood at 2% in October 2025, reflecting the combined impact of changes in core CPI components. Services accounted for 1.74% of the monthly core inflation rate, while core food and retail items contributed 0.20% and 0.10%, respectively.",415,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8845880627632141,2025-12-08T21:29:37.213040
2025-12-07,Egyptian developers offer unprecedented cash discounts amid mounting market pressures,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/egyptian-developers-offer-unprecedented-cash-discounts-amid-mounting-market-pressures/,"“It is impossible for residential unit prices to drop, unlike cars,” said Osama Saad, CEO of the Real Estate Development Chamber, as developers grapple with rising costs and shifting market conditions.
Saad explained that recent fluctuations in the exchange rate and construction material prices prompted a series of meetings with developers to explore potential price reductions. However, it was agreed that unit prices in projects where one or two phases have already been sold will remain unchanged. Instead, developers are offering additional in-kind benefits, such as upgraded finishing packages or contributions toward club memberships, to attract buyers without altering base prices.
In recent months, the market has seen cash payment discounts exceeding 50%, an unprecedented level for Egypt’s real estate sector. Several developers have introduced these aggressive offers to boost liquidity and maintain construction momentum amid rising costs and tightening financing conditions. Traditionally, cash discounts have ranged from 25% to 30%, but recent pressures have pushed them significantly higher.
In East Cairo, particularly the New Administrative Capital, Mostakbal City, and the Fifth Settlement, cash discounts ranged between 25% and 50%. In West Cairo, projects recorded discounts of around 30%. Madinet Masr stood out by offering what marketers say is the highest announced cash discount so far: 55% for immediate full payments.
Abdallah Sallam, President and CEO of Madinet Masr, said the company’s offers reflect current purchasing power and evolving customer preferences. Madinet Masr, he explained, continuously designs flexible payment plans tailored to diverse client segments. The current discount levels, he noted, align with prevailing interest rates and offer buyers a balanced financial alternative.
Sallam emphasised that upfront-payment incentives aim to stimulate demand and provide practical solutions in the current economic environment. These offers help companies reinforce cash flow, supporting construction and operational commitments. He added that such approaches bolster the appeal of real estate as a stable investment while ensuring Madinet Masr’s long-term financial and operational resilience.
However, not all industry voices are optimistic. Mohamed Samir, CEO of Elite Consulting, said the steep cash discounts signal mounting pressures in the market. He warned that the sector faces a “real crisis” that could intensify in the first and second quarters of 2026 due to liquidity shortages, slowing sales, and rising rates of unit returns.
Samir noted that Egypt lacks a robust mortgage financing system capable of supporting demand, leaving developers dependent on cash discounts to secure liquidity. Much of this cash, he added, is directed toward covering immediate financial obligations and completing ongoing projects. Access to bank financing remains limited, available only to a small number of large developers and often requiring lengthy processing times, which weakens financial sustainability across the sector.
He highlighted that 2022 and 2023 witnessed a surge in new project launches and strong sales, with many units scheduled for delivery in 2026. But current liquidity constraints and slowing sales could affect delivery timelines and challenge some developers’ ability to meet obligations to clients.
Abd Elrahman Abozeid, Senior Sales Team Leader at Taskeen, a subsidiary of Nawy specialising in proptech solutions, said the large cash discounts have generated “noticeable movement” in the real estate market in recent months. He noted that the offers have boosted demand for ready units and projects nearing completion. While upfront-payment discounts in such projects typically remain below 50%, they tend to increase as construction advances.
Abozeid added that the primary objective of these offers is to stimulate sales and secure the cash flow required to complete projects. Discount levels, he said, vary based on the size of the upfront payment and the conditions of each project.",593,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8838165998458862,2025-12-08T21:29:40.052171

This move is part of Egypt’s broader efforts to improve the business climate and offer more efficient, transparent services to investors.
The announcement followed the final meeting of the technical committee overseeing the review and update of the framework, chaired by GAFI CEO Hossam Heiba. The session also included key participants such as Dalia El-Hawary, Deputy CEO for Institutional Development, Research, and Economic Performance, along with experts from prominent Egyptian and international audit firms and relevant authorities.
The committee focused on streamlining accounting standards, improving procedures for mergers, demergers, and corporate restructurings, and reviewing the technical treatment of companies’ financial frameworks. Additionally, the committee developed a comprehensive approach for pre-investment financial reviews, aligning with international best practices while addressing practical challenges and proposing measures to support Egypt’s digital transformation.
CEO Hossam Heiba highlighted that the updated framework is crucial for strengthening Egypt’s investment environment. It will foster greater transparency, improve technical accuracy, and better meet investor needs. He also emphasized that GAFI’s ongoing modernization efforts aim to digitize services and enhance the quality of services in line with global standards and Egypt’s investment priorities.
“We will closely monitor the implementation of these reforms, gather stakeholder feedback, and continue making improvements,” said Heiba, stressing the importance of regular follow-up meetings to track progress and achieve long-term institutional impact.
El-Hawary added that the committee used an in-depth analytical approach, examining existing models and international case studies to develop actionable recommendations for improving valuation and financial review processes. She emphasized that the new framework will boost the reliability and consistency of valuation results across GAFI’s technical departments.
As part of its digital transformation initiative, GAFI also introduced a new online platform for financial review services. The platform allows investors to submit requests, track their status, and receive real-time updates and notifications, marking a significant shift toward greater digital integration and efficiency. This initiative aims to reduce review times, enhance transparency, and improve communication with investors.
GAFI stated that the updated framework and digital platform are part of a wider series of reforms designed to improve Egypt’s competitiveness, attract both domestic and foreign investment, and strengthen investor confidence. The authority is committed to closely monitoring these reforms to ensure their successful implementation and positive impact on the business community.",401,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.5446624159812927,2025-12-08T21:29:42.887197

sat down with Olivia Toderean, Ambassador of Romania to Egypt, to discuss the roadmap for this milestone. From unlocking trade potential and navigating regional geopolitical challenges to fostering a modern cultural dialogue, Ambassador Toderean shares her vision for a partnership that honors the past while aggressively pursuing the opportunities of the future.
Beyond the Celebration: Our nations are approaching a remarkable milestone: 120 years of continuous diplomatic relations. Your Excellency, the 120th anniversary is a powerful symbol. But to make it truly meaningful, it must be a catalyst for action. When you stand alongside your Egyptian counterparts on April 1, 2026, what specific, tangible outcome—be it a major trade agreement, a new investment project, or a strategic policy declaration—do you hope to announce that will define the next chapter of our relationship?
You are absolutely right, and I believe this is the approach both in Bucharest and in Cairo. While some of the preparations are too early to reveal, I can assure you they are substantial. It is clear that the 120th anniversary of Romanian–Egyptian diplomatic relations is not only a moment of celebration but also an excellent opportunity to project our partnership into the future.
Over the past century, our nations have built relations of trust, solidarity, and respect—from political dialogue to economic and cultural exchanges, as well as educational cooperation. Now, as we approach this milestone, our priority is to translate that history into new, tangible achievements. We would like the anniversary to be marked by more than symbolic gestures. Together with our Egyptian partners, we are working so that throughout 2026 we can announce a set of flagship outcomes that will truly define the next chapter of our relations.
Beyond government-to-government agreements, we also want this anniversary to bring benefits felt by our peoples. We are therefore paying close attention to fostering people-to-people contacts, cultural and academic partnerships, and opportunities for young generations to know and understand each other better.
In short, what matters most is that this anniversary should leave behind more than memories. It should create the foundation for new opportunities, sustainable development, innovation, and deepening the friendship that has linked Romania and Egypt for over a century. The fact that Romania will be the Guest of Honor at the Cairo International Book Fair 2026—a flagship cultural event that highlights the rich cultural tapestry of Egypt—is just one of the significant projects for 2026. We will bring numerous Egyptian and Romanian writers, cultural debates, workshops, and round tables to our national pavilion. I promise you there will be many pleasant surprises that will attract our Egyptian readers and expand the circles of our Egyptian friends.
Olivia Toderean
Reimagining the Pillars: For decades, this relationship was built on solid pillars: political solidarity, cultural exchange, and educational ties that saw thousands of Egyptians study in Romania. Looking forward, what do you believe should be the new pillars of the Egypt-Romania strategic relationship in the 21st century? Are they in energy, digital transformation, and logistics, or something else entirely?
Indeed, the traditional pillars of our bilateral relationship remain a living foundation that continues to inspire us today. However, in the 21st century, it is our duty to contextualize these pillars differently. The world around us is transforming at an unprecedented pace, and Romania and Egypt, both situated at geopolitical crossroads, have a special responsibility to adapt and innovate together.
Looking forward, we see
energy
—with a focus on renewables and the broader green transition—as a natural area of cooperation. Both Romania and Egypt are investing in sustainable energy solutions, and there is great potential to connect our efforts, whether in technology, innovation, investment, or joint projects that serve our citizens and contribute to climate resilience.
Logistics and connectivity
are another strategic field. Egypt plays a central role as a regional hub through the Suez Canal and its modernized ports, while Romania represents a gateway to the European Union, the Black Sea, and Eastern Europe.

Linking these advantages in a more systematic way could position our countries as essential partners in ensuring supply chain resilience between Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.
We are also convinced that
digital transformation
and the knowledge economy must be at the heart of the new agenda. Digital skills, artificial intelligence, and the integration of new technologies into health, education, and governance are areas where Romania has experience as a European IT hub, and where Egypt’s young and dynamic population offers extraordinary potential.
At the same time, I would emphasize that people-to-people connections will remain the soul of our relationship. The ties that once brought Egyptian doctors, engineers, and artists to study in Romania can now evolve into new forms of cooperation. So, to answer your question: the new pillars will certainly include energy, digital innovation, and connectivity, but they must also be complemented by the timeless human dimension—education, culture, and direct
Unlocking Trade Potential: Our bilateral trade is healthy, but many analysts believe it is performing below its potential. What are the key barriers preventing more Romanian companies from entering the Egyptian market, and how can we better position Egyptian exports to find a home in Romania and the wider EU market?
You are right to point out that our bilateral trade, while solid and growing, has not yet reached its full potential. I must recognize that the trend of 2024 was slightly disappointing compared to recent years, but in the first half of 2025, there seems to be a bounce back—I am eagerly looking forward to the figures at the end of this year.
The complementarities are evident: Romanian expertise in IT, cybersecurity, automotive components, and advanced agriculture pairs well with Egypt’s role as a manufacturing hub and a market of over 100 million people.
Barriers do exist, such as limited mutual visibility. Romanian SMEs may be unfamiliar with the Egyptian business culture, just as Egyptian exporters may find EU standards complex. We also need stronger logistical and financial connectivity. However, these are not structural roadblocks; they are challenges that can be addressed with targeted policies.
Regarding Egyptian exports, the answer lies in moving up the value chain. Beyond traditional goods, there is real potential for processed food products, textiles with higher value-added, chemicals, fertilizers, and renewable energy technologies. Romania, with its Black Sea ports and modern transport links into Central and Western Europe, can serve as an entry point for these Egyptian products into the EU single market.
The Energy Bridge: Black Sea to the Mediterranean: Romania is a significant energy producer in Europe. Egypt is positioning itself as a major regional energy hub for LNG and green hydrogen. How do you envision a strategic energy partnership between our two countries?
Energy is without a doubt one of the most promising areas of the Romanian–Egyptian partnership. There is an ongoing dialogue between EGAS and its Romanian counterpart, Transgaz, on joint projects of significance. CisGaz from Romania has developed a series of projects in partnership with Town Gas in Egypt, taking place in both countries. We are currently supporting other emerging projects in green energy, and hopefully, I will be able to share good news by next year in this field too.
Romania is already a significant energy producer in Europe. Except for peak periods in winter, we will be self-sufficient with a mix of green, nuclear, and gas-based production. Egypt has ambitious plans for green hydrogen and solar energy. We can certainly collaborate in energy engineering and technology, including offshore exploration.
Port to Port: Constanța and the Suez Canal: How can we create a more robust logistical and trade corridor between our key ports?
The Port of Constanța and the Suez Canal are not only vital for our respective countries but for global trade. If we think strategically, linking these two gateways more closely could create a powerful corridor between Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
I also see great potential in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE), a priority I am actively promoting to Romanian companies. For those seeking to expand into Africa and the Gulf, the SCZONE offers a unique platform. Positioning the zone as a natural destination for Romanian business—in industries ranging from agri-food to light manufacturing and IT—would give our partnership a tangible, future-oriented dimension.
A Bridge to Brussels: As an influential EU member state, how can Bucharest help shape a more nuanced and supportive EU policy toward Egypt?
Romania has always valued its role as a constructive bridge between the European Union and the wider Middle East. The context is very favorable to EU-Egypt relations—the only strategic and comprehensive partnership the EU has signed so far.
On water security and the Nile, Romania encourages dialogue that acknowledges Egypt’s vital interests. On regional stability, we promote balanced policies that reflect Egypt’s indispensable role in maintaining peace. This positioning was proven once again by the overwhelming majority of Romanian MPs who voted in favor of the European Parliament’s adoption of the €4 billion macro-financial assistance package for Egypt in April 2025.
The Ukraine War: What is your message to the Egyptian people about the resilience of the Black Sea grain corridor and Europe’s long-term strategy to ensure global food supply chains?
Romania has been at the frontline of the geopolitical and humanitarian crisis triggered by Russia’s war against Ukraine. To mitigate the dire consequences on food security, Romania took decisive steps to ensure that Ukrainian grain reaches global markets—over 50 million tons have transited our country. Moving from zero transit before the war to millions of tons per year was an enormous logistical challenge, but we remained committed.
At the same time, we are doing our own homework to increase our food exports. Keep in mind that Romania has been the 3rd largest exporter of wheat to Egypt in recent years, and we are actively working to enhance this market share.
The Gaza Crisis: What role can Romania play in supporting mediation and humanitarian relief?
Romania has always believed in dialogue, balance, and respect for international law. From Cairo, I have the privilege of listening closely to Egyptian interlocutors who are at the heart of mediation efforts. We support Egypt’s mediation role as indispensable.
Romania has supported the vision of two states—Israel and Palestine—living side by side in peace and security for decades. We also emphasize the humanitarian dimension. Romania has contributed aid and executed international evacuations to EU Member States for urgent medical cases, especially children. Around 50 children are currently being treated in Romanian hospitals, accompanied by approximately 100 family members.
Revitalizing Educational Ties: How can we revive and modernize the educational bridge between our nations?
We are actively encouraging stronger links between Romanian and Egyptian universities through joint research initiatives and double-degree programs. For example, there are new discussions between Alexandria University and Babeș-Bolyai University regarding a partnership.
Beyond traditional programs, Romania is exploring opportunities in online learning and tech incubators. A recent success is the training program organized by the Romanian Silver Screen Film School in partnership with the American University in Cairo. The first edition was a success, and I hope to see it grow, as the film and entertainment industry can bring significant economic growth.
Beyond Dracula and the Pyramids: How can our two countries foster a more contemporary cultural exchange?
Moving “beyond Dracula and the Pyramids” means embracing the full richness of who we are today. Romania hosts world-class festivals like the Sibiu International Theater Festival (FITS) and the Transylvania International Film Festival (TIFF). Likewise, Egypt is witnessing a flourishing of theater, cinema, and design.
We need to make sure our modern stories reach wider audiences. I was incredibly proud when a Romanian film won the supreme trophy at the Cairo International Film Festival last year. In essence, Romania and Egypt both have stories to tell that are as modern and dynamic as our relations are ancient.
Finally, Madam Ambassador, when you look back on your time in Cairo, what is the one human connection or diplomatic breakthrough you hope to have fostered?
This is perhaps the most difficult question. As I am only approaching the middle of my mandate, it is too early to speak of a diplomatic breakthrough in retrospect. I promise to answer this in a special interview with
Daily News Egypt
as I approach the end of my tenure!
As for the human connection, I can already say there isn’t just one, but many. I have made friendships here that have changed me and will remain with me for a lifetime. These connections span culture, science, business, and civil society. Even at mid-mandate, I can say without hesitation that the human connections I’ve made in Cairo have been one of the greatest pleasant surprises I have experienced, not only as an ambassador but as a person.",2180,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.6098382472991943,2025-12-08T21:29:50.553068
2025-12-06,US warns NATO allies against ‘bullying’ American defence firms amid protectionism row,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/06/us-warns-nato-allies-against-bullying-american-defence-firms-amid-protectionism-row/,"US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau has criticised European NATO allies for prioritising domestic defence companies over American suppliers, warning partners against “bullying” US firms or excluding them from the continent’s rearmament efforts.
According to diplomatic sources cited by
Politico
, Landau delivered the admonition during a closed-door meeting of NATO foreign ministers on Wednesday, urging allies to ensure American contractors are not shut out of the market as Europe moves to bolster its military industry.
The intervention comes amid heightened transatlantic tensions over trade and defence spending, with Washington increasingly wary of European Union initiatives designed to foster “sovereign” military capabilities.
A US State Department official confirmed the substance of Landau’s message, stating he conveyed two primary points: the need for Europe to convert defence spending pledges into tangible capabilities, and a warning that “protectionist and exclusionary policies that shut out US companies undermine our collective defence”.
The meeting marked the first time in over two decades that a US Secretary of State has missed a NATO ministerial gathering, with Marco Rubio absent from the talks.
Transatlantic Trade Tensions
Landau’s comments reflect a broader strategy by the current US administration to pressure historic partners on trade terms. President Donald Trump has frequently criticised the EU for “unfair” treatment of the United States, while the bloc has previously described Washington’s trade demands as tantamount to “blackmail”.
The dispute over defence procurement arises as NATO allies have pledged to spend 5 per cent of GDP on defence by 2035. Concurrently, the EU is allocating €150bn in defence grants for joint procurement, implementing strict controls that encourage intra-European purchasing and reduce reliance on third countries.
Despite the friction, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte noted on Wednesday that allies, including Canada and European nations, have pledged $4bn to a NATO-backed plan funding US defence firms to supply Ukraine.
US Dominance and Market Share
American defence contractors are seeking to secure their position in the European market, which accounts for approximately 11 per cent of annual revenue for major players such as Lockheed Martin and RTX.
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), US firms have strengthened their global foothold, capturing 43 per cent of arms exports over the past five years, up from 35 per cent in the previous period.
In Europe, reliance on American hardware remains high. SIPRI data indicates that arms imports by European NATO members more than doubled between the 2015–2019 and 2020–2024 periods. The US supplied 64 per cent of these weapons, a significant increase from 52 per cent previously.
Thirteen European nations, including Britain, Germany, and Italy, have procured or ordered US-made F-35 fighter jets. European armies have also bolstered stocks of RTX’s Patriot air defence systems and HIMARS rocket launchers.
To maintain market access, US firms are deepening ties with European counterparts. Lockheed Martin is establishing missile production lines with Germany’s Rheinmetall, while a joint venture between Raytheon and European missile maker MBDA will produce Patriot missiles in Germany.
European Industry Growth
Europe’s domestic defence sector is also expanding after years of underinvestment. The AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) reported that the sector grew by 13.8 per cent in 2024, generating revenues of €183.4bn ($213bn). Employment in the sector rose by 8.6 per cent to 633,000 jobs.
However, the ASD warned of persistent challenges, including supply chain bottlenecks, shortages of raw materials and electronic components, high energy costs, and labour market constraints.
Micael Johansson, ASD prominent figure and CEO of Saab, told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday that the continent must persist in building its own industrial base.
“We have to ensure that the defence industry continues to support the building of European sovereign capabilities that enhance deterrence and defence,” Johansson said. “That cannot stop just because a ceasefire is reached or negotiations begin.”",633,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9011713266372681,2025-12-08T21:29:55.887628
2025-10-13,S&P Global Ratings upgrade signals renewed confidence in Egypt’s economy: CBE Governor,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/13/sp-global-ratings-upgrade-signals-renewed-confidence-in-egypts-economy-cbe-governor/,"Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) Hassan Abdalla welcomed S&P Global Ratings’ decision to upgrade Egypt’s sovereign credit rating, describing it as a clear reflection of growing international confidence in the national economy. He attributed the move to the success of recent monetary and structural reforms implemented by the government and the CBE.
Abdalla highlighted that the unification of Egypt’s exchange rate regime marked a pivotal step towards restoring market stability and boosting investor confidence. He noted that the improvement in external sector indicators and the rise in foreign exchange reserves demonstrate the effectiveness of the economic policies currently in place.
The governor reaffirmed the CBE’s commitment to maintaining disciplined monetary policies aimed at containing inflation, safeguarding financial stability, and ensuring sustainable economic growth. These efforts, he said, have strengthened the trust of international institutions and investors in Egypt’s economic outlook.
On Friday, S&P Global Ratings upgraded Egypt’s long-term sovereign credit rating to “B” from “B-” with a stable outlook—the first such upgrade in seven years. The agency explained that the decision reflects Egypt’s reform momentum over the past 18 months, including the liberalisation of the foreign exchange regime, which has supported a strong rebound in GDP growth during fiscal year 2025.
S&P further noted that Egypt’s shift to a flexible exchange rate regime has bolstered economic resilience, contributing to higher tourism revenues, robust remittance inflows, and stronger net financial inflows—all of which have improved the country’s external position.
In a related development, Fitch Ratings affirmed Egypt’s long-term foreign-currency rating at ‘B’ with a stable outlook, citing resilient economic performance, improving external indicators, and continued fiscal reform efforts despite regional challenges.
Both assessments, Abdalla said, underscore the success of Egypt’s ongoing reform agenda and its ability to navigate global and regional headwinds while maintaining economic stability and growth momentum.",301,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9568681716918945,2025-12-08T21:30:00.275855
2025-10-04,"Inflation expectations still face upside risks domestically, globally: CBE",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/04/inflation-expectations-still-face-upside-risks-domestically-globally-cbe/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has stated that inflation expectations remain exposed to upside risks stemming from both domestic and global factors, including regulated price adjustments exceeding projections and rising geopolitical tensions in the region.
At its meeting last Thursday, the CBE’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to reduce the bank’s key policy rates by 1 percentage point, setting the overnight deposit rate at 21%, the overnight lending rate at 22%, and both the main operation rate and the discount rate at 21.5%.
In a statement following the meeting, the MPC said the decision reflects its assessment of the latest inflation developments and the evolving outlook since its previous meeting, noting that the move aims to sustain the disinflation process while maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Global Context: Gradual Easing and Stable Inflation Expectations
On the global front, the Committee observed that recent indicators point to a moderate recovery in growth, accompanied by stable inflation expectations. As a result, many central banks in advanced and emerging economies have continued to ease monetary policy gradually, responding to fast-changing global conditions.
Oil prices have largely remained stable, though some recent upward pressures have emerged due to supply factors. Meanwhile, agricultural commodity prices have exhibited mixed but limited movements.
Despite these stabilising trends, the MPC warned that global growth and inflation remain vulnerable to several risks — most notably the potential escalation of geopolitical tensions and ongoing uncertainty surrounding global trade policies.
Domestic Economy: Growth Accelerates but Remains Below Potential
Domestically, Egypt’s real GDP growth accelerated to 5% in the second quarter (Q2) of 2025, up from 4.8% in the previous quarter. Consequently, average growth for FY 2024/2025 reached 4.4%, compared with 2.4% in FY 2023/2024.
This improvement was primarily driven by non-oil manufacturing, tourism, and trade, which collectively supported the ongoing recovery in economic activity.
However, the MPC noted that output still remains below potential, meaning that current levels of economic activity continue to support the anticipated short-term disinflation path. Under the present monetary policy stance, demand-side inflationary pressures are expected to stay contained.
Inflation Dynamics: Easing Headline and Core Rates
The Committee reported that annual headline inflation fell to 12% in August 2025, down from 13.9% in July, while annual core inflation declined to 10.7% from 11.6%.
This moderation, according to the MPC, reflects subdued monthly inflation developments in August — 0.4% for headline inflation and 0.1% for core inflation — largely driven by declining food prices and relative stability in non-food components.
The MPC highlighted that the broad-based easing in monthly inflation over the past three months signals improving inflation expectations and the gradual unwinding of previous supply shocks.
In light of these developments, CBE estimates indicate that inflation will continue to decelerate, averaging between 12% and 13% in the third quarter (Q3) of the current year, compared with 15.2% in the previous quarter.
Over the medium term, inflation is projected to continue its downward trend, albeit at a slower pace, shaped by gradual declines in non-food inflation and the impact of ongoing fiscal consolidation measures.
Policy Outlook: Sustaining the Disinflation Path
According to the MPC’s projections, average headline inflation is expected to hover around 14% in 2025, approaching the CBE’s target range by Q4 2026.
“Given the progress achieved in disinflation and the improved inflation outlook, the Committee judged that cutting the CBE’s key policy rates by 100 basis points was appropriate to anchor expectations and support the anticipated disinflation path,” the statement said.
The MPC reaffirmed its data-dependent approach, emphasising that the pace of future monetary easing will be assessed on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Decisions will continue to depend on the evolving inflation outlook, risk balance, and incoming data.
It added that the CBE remains fully committed to achieving price stability, and “will not hesitate to use all available monetary tools” to guide inflation toward its targets of 7% (±2%) in Q4 2026 and 5% (±2%) in Q4 2028, on average.
The MPC’s latest rate cut reflects confidence in Egypt’s ongoing disinflation trend amid improving inflation expectations, stronger growth momentum, and continued stability in global prices. However, the CBE cautioned that risks remain tilted to the upside, particularly from potential regulated price adjustments and heightened geopolitical tensions, underscoring the need for vigilance as it calibrates the path of monetary easing.",711,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8450037837028503,2025-12-08T21:30:03.153894

The milestone supports the Ministry’s strategy to boost production, expand exports, enhance value added and strengthen national industries.
The shipment, valued at $2m, departed from Adabiya Port and included 20,000 tonnes of calcined petroleum coke produced from 27,000 tonnes of green petroleum coke.
The export marks the beginning of a new operational phase for the factory—located within the Ain Sokhna economic zone—following the completion of comprehensive rehabilitation and maintenance works across its production units.
Minister of Public Enterprises Sector Mohamed El-Shimy said the factory’s return to production and export reflects the state’s success in revitalising national industries and enhancing their competitiveness. He noted that the Ministry is pursuing an overarching vision to maximise the productive capacity of its affiliated companies, improve operational efficiency, increase industrial exports and deepen local content.
El-Shimy described the facility’s restart as a strategic move that restores a vital supply chain to Egyptian industry, particularly the aluminium sector, while contributing to higher exports and increased foreign currency revenues. He praised the factory’s workforce and reaffirmed the Ministry’s commitment to improving working conditions to ensure high performance and sustainable operations.
He added that reviving EgyptAnode forms part of the Ministry’s broader reform programme aimed at enabling its subsidiaries to operate as strong, competitive and sustainable industrial entities with greater contributions to the national economy.
Current operational data shows the factory is running at full capacity on its first production line, with an annual output of 130,000 tonnes. Production is expected to double to 260,000 tonnes per year in the first quarter of 2026 with the launch of the second line, raising projected annual revenues to around $25m.
In January 2025, EgyptAnode signed a five-year cooperation agreement with BP to implement rehabilitation works, enhance production and achieve the highest levels of operational efficiency—supporting the factory’s long-term competitiveness.
EgyptAnode is one of the first companies in the Middle East specialising in the calcination of green petroleum coke. It plays a key role in supplying essential raw materials to the aluminium industry and related heavy industries, relying on modern technologies and strict quality and safety standards that reinforce its position as a core pillar of national manufacturing.",401,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9271532297134399,2025-12-08T21:30:13.624763

He noted that the ministry now holds 3.5 billion electronic invoices and receipts that it aims to analyse more deeply to support the economy and improve service quality.
Kouchouk stressed that the government intends to work closely with all stakeholders to make effective use of the vast volume of data generated through automation and digital transformation. This “information wealth,” he said, represents a major opportunity for investment in AI.
Speaking at the “Future of the Accounting and Auditing Profession in Egypt in the Age of Artificial Intelligence” conference, organised by the Egyptian Society of Accountants and Auditors, the minister affirmed that artificial intelligence has the capacity to significantly boost productivity and revenues, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of public services.
He emphasised that the continuous development of the accounting and auditing profession is, in itself, a strong investment in Egypt’s broader economic competitiveness.
Kouchouk said the ministry will continue upgrading its systems to build more efficient, accessible and business-friendly tax services capable of supporting economic growth. He added that the government is closely attentive to recommendations made by accounting and auditing experts and is “highly open” to ambitious ideas, backed by incentives and institutional support.
The minister noted that the ministry aims to launch exceptional, long-term programmes for training and capacity building, in addition to expanding local and international partnerships to elevate the accounting and auditing profession.

2025-12-01,"UNCTAD warns of unprecedented economic collapse in Occupied Palestinian Territory, urges urgent reconstruction",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/01/unctad-warns-of-unprecedented-economic-collapse-in-occupied-palestinian-territory-urges-urgent-reconstruction/,"A new report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) warns that prolonged military operations and long-standing restrictions have driven the economy of the Occupied Palestinian Territory into its most severe contraction on record, erasing decades of development gains and deepening fiscal and social fragility.
The report, Developments in the Economy of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, finds that two years of military escalation and movement restrictions have triggered an unprecedented economic collapse across the Palestinian economy. This has unfolded against a backdrop of structural vulnerabilities, with far-reaching social, environmental and institutional consequences.
According to UNCTAD, extensive damage to infrastructure, productive assets and public services has reversed decades of socio-economic progress. The resulting crisis is now among the ten worst economic contractions recorded globally since 1960, while conditions in Gaza represent the most severe downturn on record.
At the same time, plummeting revenues and the withholding of fiscal transfers by the Israeli Government have severely constrained the Palestinian Government’s ability to maintain essential services or invest in recovery at a moment when large-scale spending is urgently required. The escalation has pushed the Palestinian economy from a prolonged slowdown into a near-total collapse, with repercussions across all sectors. In Gaza, the entire population has fallen into multidimensional poverty. The West Bank is experiencing its sharpest economic downturn on record, driven by heightened insecurity, increased movement restrictions and a collapse in productive activity.
By the end of 2024, Palestinian GDP had fallen back to its 2010 level, while GDP per capita returned to that of 2003—effectively wiping out 22 years of development gains in under two years.
Gaza: Economy reduced to a fraction of its former size
For nearly twenty years, 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza have lived under severe restrictions on trade, movement and access to resources within one of the world’s most densely populated areas. Limited entry of goods, restrictions on productive inputs and technology, and recurrent military operations have dismantled Gaza’s productive base, creating near-total dependence on external assistance.
In 2024 alone, Gaza’s GDP contracted by 83% compared with 2023, following a major decline the previous year. Over 2023–2024, GDP shrank cumulatively by 87% to $362m. GDP per capita fell to $161—among the lowest globally—and is now just 4.6% of the West Bank’s per capita income, down from near parity in 1994.
Destruction of infrastructure, widespread loss of productive capacity and mass displacement have caused lasting damage to human capital. Disruptions to education and basic services will have long-term consequences for livelihoods and societal resilience. Housing, utilities and essential infrastructure have been devastated, cutting off access to food, water, healthcare and public services, and creating an acute humanitarian and economic emergency.
UNCTAD warns that even with substantial international assistance, recovery to pre-October 2023 GDP levels could take decades. It stresses that ensuring the durability of the October 2025 ceasefire is essential to enable meaningful reconstruction, while humanitarian aid remains urgently needed.
West Bank: Sharpest downturn on record
Settlement expansion and movement restrictions continue to fragment the West Bank, constrain trade and investment, and reduce access to land, markets and resources for more than 3.3 million Palestinians. These constraints increase transport costs, lengthen travel times and disrupt access to employment, education and healthcare.
Since late 2023, movement restrictions have intensified further, sharply reducing economic activity. West Bank GDP contracted by 17%, while GDP per capita fell by 18.8%, returning to levels last seen in 2014 and 2008 respectively.
Fiscal pressures deepen institutional strain
The fiscal situation deteriorated markedly after October 2023, making 2024 one of the most challenging years for the Palestinian Government. Revenue shortfalls, the withholding of fiscal transfers, a contracting economy and declining external support have deepened the crisis, with pressures continuing into 2025.
Between January 2019 and April 2025, cumulative deductions and withheld fiscal transfers amounted to an estimated $1.76bn—equivalent to 12.8% of GDP in 2024 and 44% of total net revenues. Combined with a shrinking tax base and falling donor contributions, these shortfalls have severely limited the Government’s capacity to pay salaries, sustain essential functions and deliver basic services.
UNCTAD stresses that urgent and sustained international financial support is needed to stabilise public finances, safeguard institutional capacity and enable effective reconstruction.
Rebuilding Gaza requires more than $70bn
UNCTAD estimates the cost of reconstruction and recovery in Gaza at more than $70bn, underscoring the scale of investment needed to rebuild infrastructure, restore services and revive livelihoods.
The report calls for immediate and coordinated international intervention to halt the economic collapse, address the deepening humanitarian crisis and lay the foundations for sustainable peace and development. It urges a comprehensive recovery plan for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, coupled with restored fiscal transfers and measures to ease constraints on movement, trade and investment.
UNCTAD’s role
For nearly four decades, UNCTAD has provided policy research, technical cooperation and capacity-building support to the Palestinian people. Its work focuses on trade facilitation, productive capacity and institutional development, in partnership with public and private stakeholders and civil society, while also promoting international consensus on the needs of the Palestinian economy.",837,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9672011137008667,2025-12-08T21:30:21.681620

The framework, titled the “Real Estate Regulatory Unit,” aims to create a permanent system to oversee the sector, protect the rights of buyers and investors, and curb market manipulation and unregulated practices. Qoura said the plan would help stabilise the property market, improve project execution, eliminate “illusory property sales,” and position real estate as a driver of sustainable economic growth.
He stressed that the proposal’s core objective is to safeguard investors’ funds, protect buyers’ rights, and establish a fair legal structure that also supports developers and promotes overall market stability. Qoura added that, despite the sector’s strategic economic importance, particularly for Egyptians at home and abroad, as well as Arab and Gulf investors, Egypt still lacks a comprehensive law governing real estate transactions.
Under the proposal, a national real estate authority would be established to regulate the market and supervise projects. Each project would be required to operate a mandatory escrow account into which all customer payments and financing would be deposited. Disbursement to developers would be tied to verified construction progress, monitored by a general consultant and the proposed authority, to ensure timely and compliant project delivery.
The system, Qoura noted, is designed to benefit both buyers and developers. Buyers’ funds would be protected, while developers would be shielded from risks arising from unforeseen economic shocks such as currency devaluation. Compensation would be limited to actual cost differences without additional profit margins, helping ensure projects are completed even under challenging conditions.
The proposal also calls for unifying sales contracts across real estate companies, requiring standardised and transparent data on unit areas, pricing, services and facilities. This measure aims to reduce price disparities and curb unfair practices across the sector.
Drawing on international models tailored to Egypt’s market, the draft incorporates elements from the regulatory experiences of the UAE, Saudi Arabia and the United States, adapted to local circumstances.
Key features include the creation of a national coordinating body composed of representatives from the Ministries of Housing, Justice and Finance, as well as the Central Bank of Egypt, to oversee projects and regulate relationships between developers, buyers and financiers.
The plan also proposes launching a unified digital monitoring platform providing a comprehensive database of all projects, developers, actual prices and construction progress. Linked to banks, financing institutions and the New Urban Communities Authority, the platform would enhance transparency and enable real-time oversight.
To speed up dispute resolution, the proposal recommends establishing a specialised judicial unit comprising judges, legal advisers and engineering experts to handle real estate disputes efficiently, avoiding delays associated with traditional civil courts.
Additional measures include requiring developers to issue a digital unit identification certificate detailing the approved area, true price per square metre, project registration number and the project’s dedicated bank account. The draft also bans vague or misleading terminology in sales contracts.
The proposal seeks to attract foreign investment through tax and administrative incentives for environmentally compliant developers, simplified registration procedures for foreign buyers and strengthened international marketing of Egyptian real estate through embassies and diplomatic missions.
Post-delivery management is also addressed through provisions for dedicated maintenance accounts, with maintenance deposits transferred to homeowners’ associations to ensure service sustainability.
The proposal will now be examined by the relevant Senate committees before being referred to the House of Representatives and subsequently to the government for further consideration.",632,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.8861126899719238,2025-12-08T21:30:24.544949
2025-12-06,Netanyahu’s pick for Mossad chief sparks resignation threats over lack of experience,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/06/netanyahus-pick-for-mossad-chief-sparks-resignation-threats-over-lack-of-experience/,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to appoint his Military Secretary, Major General Roman Gofman, as the new head of the Mossad foreign intelligence agency has sparked a political storm and threats of mass resignations among agency officials, Israeli media reported.
Channel 13 cited current and former Mossad officials describing Gofman as a “veteran warrior” who nonetheless lacks essential experience in the world of intelligence.
“This is a severe blow to the organisation. Gofman’s appointment could put an end to the golden age of the institution,” a senior Mossad official told the channel.
Critics also pointed to a “problematic” issue in Gofman’s biography involving the employment of a teenager in an influence campaign, which reportedly resulted in the youth’s prolonged detention.
A senior security official previously described the appointment process as “delusional”, alleging that the Prime Minister’s wife, Sara Netanyahu, was unofficially involved. The official claimed she interviewed Gofman for the Military Secretary role before the proposal was submitted to the Senior Appointments Advisory Committee.
While reports suggest Netanyahu bypassed Mossad candidates he previously supported to appoint Gofman, raising concerns over his lack of intelligence background, his allies argued that his “loyalty, wisdom, and aggressive thinking suit the position”.
The Prime Minister’s office defended the choice, highlighting Gofman’s service in various operational and command roles within the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), including in the Armored Corps and as commander of the Etzion Brigade.
“Major General Roman Gofman is a multi-talented officer. His appointment as Military Secretary to the Prime Minister at the height of the War of Resurrection proved that he possesses exceptional professional capabilities,” the statement from Netanyahu’s office said, adding that Gofman maintained continuous contact with all intelligence agencies, particularly Mossad, during his tenure.
Gofman, 49, was born in Belarus and immigrated to Israel in 1990. He holds a bachelor’s degree in political science from Ashkelon Academic College and a master’s degree in political science and national security from the University of Haifa.
The appointment comes as Netanyahu’s government faces widespread internal criticism regarding the intelligence failure to predict the October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian factions on southern Israeli towns.",356,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.6197185516357422,2025-12-08T21:30:27.414148

Speaking at a weekly press conference following a cabinet meeting at the New Administrative Capital, Madbouly confirmed that the IMF mission arrived two days ago to commence the fifth and sixth reviews of the country’s loan programme. The delegation has already held initial meetings with the Minister of Finance and the Central Bank Governor.
“There is optimism that matters will proceed within a good framework in light of the positive indicators of the Egyptian economy,” Madbouly said.
He added that the country’s economic performance is tracking in line with government hopes, noting that “indeed some economic indicators have achieved better than what was targeted with the Fund.”
In a move to further stimulate the economy, Madbouly announced that President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi has approved the launch of a second package of tax facilities.
Madbouly explained that this is the second of four planned tax packages designed to improve the investment climate and support the private sector’s expansion. The first tranche was implemented last year, with the current package planned for execution this year.
Regarding structural reforms, the Prime Minister said the government is currently updating the “State Ownership Policy Document,” as the original three-year timeframe for the policy expires this December. He expects the final draft of the updated version to be ready by March, after which it will be presented for social dialogue.",256,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9120429158210754,2025-12-08T21:30:32.618664

The agreement aims to support the development of innovative green financial products and strengthen the bank’s institutional capabilities in sustainable finance.
The signing ceremony was attended by Tamer Negm, HDB’s Assistant Managing Director for Corporate Credit, Syndicated Loans, Treasury and Investment; representatives from the Frankfurt School and GIZ; as well as senior bank officials.
Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to advancing green finance solutions and institutional capacity-building in support of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Egypt’s transition toward a green economy, in line with global trends and domestic market priorities.
The partnership aligns with HDB’s strategic direction to expand innovative financing tools that embed sustainability principles across the banking sector. It also leverages the Frankfurt School’s extensive international experience in designing and implementing sustainable finance frameworks in emerging markets.
The cooperation will enable the development of a wide range of products, including green loans, sustainability-linked financing, and frameworks for green bonds and sustainable sukuk. It will also support the creation of green investment portfolios, introduce tailored financing mechanisms for SMEs operating in the green economy, develop tools to measure the environmental impact of financial products, and roll out awareness programmes to promote sustainable finance principles among clients.
Commenting on the agreement, Tamer Negm expressed his pride in the strategic partnership and praised the Frankfurt School’s global leadership in sustainable finance. He said the MoU represents a significant milestone in HDB’s expansion of sustainable financial offerings and underscores the bank’s commitment to adopting international best practices to deliver innovative products that meet the needs of the Egyptian market amid accelerating environmental and economic transitions.
Negm highlighted that Q3 2025 marked strong momentum in the bank’s sustainable finance efforts, with HDB’s sustainable finance portfolio rising to EGP 6.93bn,  a 70% increase compared to 2024. Sustainable financing now accounts for 23% of the bank’s total corporate, syndicated loan, and SME financing portfolio, up from 13% during the same period last year, reflecting clear progress in embedding sustainability across the bank’s operations.
He added that the partnership represents a major step toward institutionalising sustainability across HDB’s activities, enhancing internal capabilities, and fostering innovative financial tools that support Egypt’s national drive towards a green economy. Negm affirmed that sustainability remains a core pillar of the bank’s identity and a fundamental component of its 2025–2030 strategy.",432,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8653440475463867,2025-12-08T21:30:35.522623
2025-12-07,GAFI launches guideline for cash investment Incentive to support industrial projects,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/gafi-launches-guideline-for-cash-investment-incentive-to-support-industrial-projects/,"Hossam Heiba, CEO of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI), announced the release of the official guideline for the new cash investment incentive dedicated to industrial projects. The initiative reflects the government’s commitment to transparency, clarity, streamlined procedures, and accessible information for investors.
Heiba confirmed that the guideline is now available to all investors and can be accessed via the email link:
[email protected]
. He added that the committee responsible for administering the incentive has begun receiving applications through the same channel.
According to Heiba, the incentive represents one of the most significant mechanisms for attracting foreign direct investment, as it provides eligible investors with a direct cash payment disbursed after taxes are paid. The value of the incentive is linked to the volume of foreign financing allocated to the project, which must account for at least 50% of the project’s total capital. In addition, eligible projects must ensure that industrial products listed in the schedule attached to the Cabinet decision represent no less than 50% of their annual turnover.
GAFI previously issued Decision No. 675 of 2025 establishing the committee tasked with granting the cash investment incentive for industrial projects. The committee is chaired by a GAFI representative and includes members from the Industrial Development Authority, the Industrial Modernisation Centre, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Central Bank of Egypt, and the Egyptian Tax Authority.
The committee’s responsibilities include assessing applications, issuing decisions, granting eligibility certificates, providing annual approvals for incentive disbursement, and issuing preliminary approvals in accordance with Cabinet Decision No. 77 of 2023.
Heiba noted that, consistent with the state’s strategy to support the industrial sector, localize manufacturing, and enhance the competitiveness of Egyptian products as a driver of economic growth, Law No. 160 of 2023 was enacted to amend certain provisions of the Investment Law. The amendment added Article 11 (bis), which provides industrial investment projects with a cash incentive without affecting other incentives already granted by the law. Cabinet Decision No. 77 of 2023 further defined the requirements, controls, and criteria for implementing the incentive—from eligibility conditions and classifications to disbursement and oversight mechanisms.
The decision also allows industrial projects to obtain a preliminary approval valid for three years, giving investors added assurance that they will receive the incentive even if regulatory changes occur during the implementation period.",390,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.8345538973808289,2025-12-08T21:30:38.351023

The event is attended by governors of Arab central banks and representatives from regional and international financial institutions.
“I am honoured to participate in the current session… which serves as an annual platform for regional dialogue and cooperation on economic and monetary trends,” Abdalla said in a statement. He noted that this year’s session comes at a critical time, in light of the challenges confronting the global economy, particularly those arising from trade wars, which demand “precise and timely responses from central banks.”
Abdalla underscored that “encouraging increased domestic production and strengthening productive capacities are two core pillars in containing inflationary pressures and achieving long-term economic stability.” He affirmed the commitment of central banks to advancing their tools in line with the evolving global economic landscape, ensuring price stability while supporting economic resilience.
The ongoing session, chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank of Sudan, addresses several key topics, including the challenges central banks face in managing shocks from trade wars, frameworks to strengthen cybersecurity, and the progress of the Comprehensive Instant Digital Payments Initiative in Arab Countries.
The session will also review the outcomes of technical committees specialising in banking supervision, financial inclusion, green financing, and financial stability. A closed session is scheduled to discuss preparations for the third round of mutual evaluations and the challenges facing the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.

He highlighted that tax revenues increased by EGP 600bn during the last fiscal year without imposing any additional burdens, thanks to a confidence-based partnership framework with the business community.
Speaking at an open dialogue with students at Nile University, Kouchouk noted that the 73% jump in private investment reflects tangible economic improvement. “No one risks their money out of courtesy,” he said, describing this as a strong step toward restoring private-sector confidence and incentivising its role as the engine of economic growth.
The minister stressed that the government’s primary focus is to increase state resources to enhance citizens’ quality of life. “We need to grow revenues to improve spending on healthcare, education, and social protection,” he said.
Kouchouk also explained that Egypt’s economic and fiscal policies prioritise supporting production and exports across all sectors, including human capital. He emphasised that Egypt remains open to global investors, offering increasingly diverse and competitive economic opportunities. “The economy is in good shape, and what is coming is even better with rising private investment,” he noted.
To simplify compliance, the ministry plans to provide tax services via a dedicated mobile application and is seeking partnerships with leading artificial intelligence firms to maximise data use and improve taxpayer services.
The minister underscored the government’s readiness to support entrepreneurial ventures, pointing out that the simplified tax system offers numerous incentives for start-ups and SMEs. He also highlighted growth in the ICT sector and the state’s aim to expand digital and service exports.
Kouchouk further highlighted efforts to reduce public debt and strengthen fiscal indicators. He said Egypt successfully cut budget-sector debt by 10% over two years, while external debt fell by around $4bn. “The government remains committed to fiscal discipline while stimulating economic activity through performance-linked incentives,” he added.
Addressing the students, Kouchouk concluded: “Public service and serving your country is both an honour and a responsibility. Youth must take part in everything we do. They are the future. Never stop dreaming, work to achieve your ambitions, and we are right behind you.”",361,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9462611675262451,2025-12-08T21:30:55.089686
2025-10-19,CBE attributes inflation slowdown to easing food prices for fourth consecutive month,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/19/cbe-attributes-inflation-slowdown-to-easing-food-prices-for-fourth-consecutive-month/,"Egypt’s annual urban headline inflation declined to 11.7% in September 2025, down from 12% in August, marking the fourth consecutive month of moderation, according to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). This deceleration was primarily driven by a sharp slowdown in annual food inflation, which dropped to 1.4% in September—its lowest level since April 2021.
While food inflation eased significantly, non-food inflation remained relatively stable. It has hovered around 20.8% since the beginning of the year and recorded 19.1% in September. However, annual core inflation—which excludes volatile items such as food and energy—accelerated to 11.3% in September from 10.7% in August. This uptick was largely attributed to rising services inflation, most notably a 12% increase in rents. Monthly core inflation reached 1.5%, compared to 1.0% in the same month last year.
Monthly urban headline inflation recorded a rate of 1.8% in September 2025, slightly below the 2.1% registered in September 2024. This monthly increase was mainly driven by higher prices for fresh fruits and vegetables as well as services.
In rural areas, headline inflation also eased, falling to 8.9% in September from 10.3% in August. On a national level, annual headline inflation declined to 10.3%, compared to 11.2% the previous month.
Despite the annual slowdown in food inflation, monthly food inflation rose to 2% in September. This increase contributed 0.7% to the monthly headline inflation rate. The rise was mainly due to increases in prices of volatile food items, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. Fresh fruit prices increased by 5.6%, while fresh vegetables rose by 15.5%. Egg prices also increased by 5.7%, contributing further to the monthly rate.
Services prices climbed by 3.2% in September, contributing 0.89% to monthly headline inflation. The notable rise in rents accounted for 0.74% of this figure, alongside increased spending in restaurants and cafés.
Retail item prices rose by 0.8% during the month, contributing 0.11%. This was mainly due to higher prices of household appliances, cleaning supplies, and personal care products, in addition to seasonal increases in clothing, stationery, and school supplies associated with the start of the academic year.
Regulated prices saw a smaller increase of 0.3%, contributing 0.07% to monthly inflation. This was driven by a 0.8% rise in tobacco prices and a 1.1% increase in the price of LPG butane gas cylinders.
Monthly core inflation reflected the cumulative impact of these developments, recording 1.5% in September. The main driver was the services category, which contributed 1.2%, followed by retail items and core food, contributing 0.2% and 0.1% respectively.",416,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.7981115579605103,2025-12-08T21:31:05.302906

The increase was largely driven by higher fuel prices, following the government’s decision to raise petroleum product prices by 10.5–12.9% in October.
The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) reported that monthly core consumer price index (CPI) climbed to 2% in October 2025, compared with 1.5% in September 2025 and 1.3% in October 2024. On an annual basis, core inflation reached 12.1%, up from 11.3% the previous month.
Meanwhile, the nationwide annual inflation rate eased slightly to 10.1% in October, compared to 10.3% in September, CAPMAS said.
The CPI for the entire country reached 264.3 points in October, marking a 1.3% monthly increase. CAPMAS attributed the rise to higher costs in several key categories, particularly food, clothing, housing, and utilities.
Notable price gains were recorded in grains and bread, meat and poultry, dairy products, oils and fats, vegetables, sugar and confectionery, beverages, and tobacco. Prices of textiles, ready-made clothing, footwear, rent, and household maintenance also moved higher.
In contrast, fish and seafood prices declined by 0.3%, fruits fell by 10.6%, and audio-visual equipment, computers, and hotel services registered minor decreases.
Looking ahead, the CBE projects average annual headline inflation to ease to 14% in 2025 and 10.5% in 2026, down from 28.3% in 2024, before converging toward its medium-term target of 7% (±2%) by Q4 2026 and 5% (±2%) by Q4 2028.
At its October meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut key interest rates by one percentage point, bringing the deposit rate to 21%, the lending rate to 22%, and the main operation and discount rates to 21.5%.
The committee said the move supports the decline in inflation expectations and reinforces monetary policy consistency, while warning that inflation remains subject to upside risks, including potential administrative price adjustments and geopolitical tensions in the region.",321,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.6626359820365906,2025-12-08T21:31:26.725285

Speaking during a meeting with an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission in Cairo, Al-Mashat reported that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth reached 5.3% in the first quarter of the year, a figure she described as exceeding expectations.
The talks were held as part of the fifth and sixth reviews of Egypt’s economic reform programme.
Al-Mashat attributed the first-quarter performance to improvements in industrial production, citing increased growth rates in sectors such as vehicles, textiles, and ready-made garments. She stated this indicates a shift toward high-productivity, tradable sectors.
To maintain macroeconomic stability, the minister highlighted the government’s adherence to a public investment ceiling of EGP 1trn last fiscal year. She noted that limiting public spending had “opened the way for more private-sector investments”.
On structural reforms, Al-Mashat pointed to the establishment of a State-Owned Enterprises Unit. The unit has been granted a mandate to maximise asset value and determine the most appropriate scenarios for state-owned companies, in line with the State Ownership Policy Document aimed at empowering the private sector.
The minister also presented “Egypt’s Narrative for Economic Development,” a framework designed to transform the economic model to focus more on production and exports. She added that the ministry’s “Quarterly GDP Note” now includes data on structural reforms to improve transparency.
Regarding climate policy, Al-Mashat told the mission that two new projects had been added to the “NWFE” country platform to support the transition to renewable energy. She also outlined efforts to integrate environmental dimensions into public investment criteria to address climate risks to assets.
The ministry is currently implementing the “Adaa” system to monitor national and sectoral policies, aiming to link allocated appropriations to specific results and ensure public spending efficiency, Al-Mashat said.",316,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7812051177024841,2025-12-08T21:31:29.595883

The initiative aligns with the World Bank Group’s goal, set in April 2024, of providing essential health services to 1.5 billion people globally by 2030.
Under the compact, Egypt has outlined a five-year reform plan focusing on strengthening primary healthcare, enhancing financial protection, and supporting job-rich economic growth. Key measures include modernising healthcare facilities, expanding digital health tools, training medical professionals, and increasing insurance coverage, all aimed at improving accessibility and affordability for citizens.
The launch comes amid regional challenges such as aging populations, rising chronic diseases, and increasing financial pressures on households. Globally, 4.6 billion people lack access to essential health services, while 2.1 billion face financial hardship due to medical costs, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable health system reforms.
Egypt’s National Health Compact includes several priority initiatives. The country is expanding digitally connected health facilities to improve service delivery, strengthening the healthcare workforce through advanced training and digital tools, and reducing financial barriers by widening health insurance coverage and providing targeted support for vulnerable populations. The plan also seeks to enhance local production of health technologies and pharmaceuticals through investment in training and the establishment of specialised Centres of Excellence.
The World Bank Group, Gavi, the Global Fund, and philanthropic partners are supporting Egypt and other compact countries with aligned financing, technical assistance, and capacity-building to ensure effective implementation of reforms.
Egypt’s participation in the National Health Compact reflects the government’s commitment to building a more resilient and equitable health system, while generating economic opportunities through healthcare expansion.",279,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7007718682289124,2025-12-08T21:31:34.812762
2025-12-07,"Amazon Egypt expands storage capacity amid rising demand, local manufacturing boom",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/amazon-egypt-expands-storage-capacity-amid-rising-demand-local-manufacturing-boom/,"Egypt has endured one of the most challenging economic periods in its recent history over the past two years. Surging inflation and sharp exchange-rate volatility have reshaped consumer behaviour, pushing households to prioritise essential goods over discretionary spending. According to Omar Elsahy, General Manager of Amazon Egypt, this shift has been clearly reflected in purchasing trends on Amazon.eg.
“Demand for essential goods, particularly food items and basic household products, has grown tremendously,” Elsahy told Daily News Egypt. “Our priority was to strengthen our presence in these categories to ensure that Egyptian families could access the essentials they rely on every day.”
At the same time, he noted, an unexpected trend has taken hold: a significant rise in the availability and quality of locally manufactured products. Egyptian factories and artisans have increased production across sectors such as apparel, home goods and personal accessories, offering high-quality items at more accessible prices.
“The rise of local manufacturing has been transformative for Egyptian e-commerce,” Elsahy said. “Customers are increasingly choosing local products not just for price, but for quality and uniqueness. Supporting these entrepreneurs is part of Amazon’s DNA, hence our dedicated storefronts and programmes for Egyptian SMEs. When local sellers succeed, customers get better selection, communities flourish, and the digital economy grows stronger. Despite economic challenges, this vibrant seller community has contributed significantly to e-commerce growth over the past three years.”
Elsahy revealed that Amazon’s storage footprint in Egypt has now expanded to more than 100,000 cubic metres. “This includes our main fulfilment centres in 10th of Ramadan and on the Suez Road, supported by several additional operational sites run through local partners.”
One of the newest facilities, he added, offers storage capacity equivalent to ten football fields, underlining Amazon’s long-term investment in Egypt’s digital infrastructure. “These expansions are not a temporary reaction to rising demand. They are part of a forward-looking strategy to prepare for the next three years of growth.”
Much of this strategy is rooted in Egypt’s progress in financial inclusion, logistics development and its advancing digital economy, all critical to enabling faster, more reliable e-commerce operations.
Since Amazon launched in Egypt in 2021, collaboration with government authorities has intensified. Elsahy described it as a “shared vision” aimed at strengthening the digital economy and empowering local manufacturers and sellers.
He noted that the Prime Minister’s meeting with Amazon’s global CEO in April served as a progress review to ensure that expansion plans align with the government’s digital-transformation and financial-inclusion agenda. “Government support has been crucial,” he said. “It facilitated licensing, enhanced the regulatory environment and enabled smoother business operations.”
Amazon has also broadened cooperation with chambers of commerce and SME-support programmes, integrating hundreds of factories and companies into its seller network. As a result, more Egyptian products are reaching wider audiences on Amazon.eg.
Financial solutions have become an increasingly important part of Amazon’s customer offering in Egypt. The company has expanded payment options through strategic partnerships with financial-service providers including Valu and several banks.
“Egyptian customers are looking for flexibility in how they pay, particularly for higher-value purchases,” Elsahy explained. “Our collaborations allow customers to spread payments over time, making more products accessible to more people.” These partnerships have introduced innovative tools, especially during major sale events such as the White Friday Sale—including 0% interest instalments, buy-now-pay-later options and exclusive discounts for specific bank cards.
“Every investment decision we make centres on customer needs,” he emphasised. “We continuously evaluate these collaborations to ensure they help customers get what they need, when they need it, at prices they can afford. That is the lens through which we view all our business decisions.”
Addressing speculation about robots, drones and other futuristic technologies, Elsahy clarified that most of Amazon’s innovation happens behind the scenes. Visible tools—such as warehouse robots or drone delivery—are not what ultimately define service quality. “What truly elevates the customer experience is faster fulfilment, higher accuracy and better availability.”
Despite economic volatility, Elsahy remains optimistic. “Egypt has tremendous potential, with strong customer demand across many categories. We grow thoughtfully, but never before we are ready to deliver a great customer experience.” His closing message reflects Amazon’s global philosophy: “Every decision begins with one question, does it serve the customer? If the answer is yes, we move. If not, we wait.”",710,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.912598192691803,2025-12-08T21:31:37.684762
2025-10-14,Egypt’s Al-Mashat expects 2026 to be ‘turning point’ for economy after Gaza deal,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/14/egypts-al-mashat-expects-2026-to-be-turning-point-for-economy-after-gaza-deal/,"Egypt’s Minister of Planning and International Cooperation said she expects 2026 to be a “turning point” for the country’s economy, with a peace deal in Gaza set to restore normal navigation in the Suez Canal and boost revenues alongside growth in industry and tourism.
Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg after the Sharm El-Sheikh peace summit, Minister of Planning Rania Al-Mashat said a sustainable settlement would be “very positive” for both Egypt and the cost of global trade.
“It is a very important day, not just for the region but for the entire world,” Al-Mashat said of the summit. “We know that the Palestinian people have suffered for two years, so reaching a resolution and laying the foundations for peace will be essential for the future of the region.”
Al-Mashat also said that President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi had a “decisive and clear vision” for achieving peace in Gaza from the beginning of the conflict, based on a full commitment to the rights of the Palestinian people.
She highlighted that Egypt had dealt flexibly with the decrease in Suez Canal traffic caused by regional tensions by implementing necessary economic reforms since March 2024. These reforms, including fiscal consolidation, a flexible exchange rate, and a ceiling on public investments, contributed to GDP growth reaching 4.4% by the end of June and 5% in the last quarter, she said.
“If we look at the structure of growth in Egypt, we find that its sources come from increased manufacturing activity, benefiting from the reforms implemented in March 2024,” Al-Mashat said, adding that the country is continuing an ambitious structural reform programme to increase competitiveness and foster private sector participation.
She pointed to recent strong investment flows, especially in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, as favourable opportunities for the Egyptian economy to increase production and exports.
Al-Mashat added that during the upcoming annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, Egypt will present its economic reform story and highlight the continuation of positive momentum following the historic summit.
She also noted that a recent credit rating upgrade by Standard & Poor’s is proof that the reforms are moving in the right direction. “We are committed to them, and we are working to open the economy further, increase competition, and overcome the challenges we faced during the past years,” she said.",389,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9381394982337952,2025-12-08T21:31:48.102859

Nationwide inflation also decelerated, falling to 11.2% from 13.1% over the same period.
The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) reported that monthly core inflation—which excludes volatile items such as food and energy—rose by just 0.1% in August, down from 0.9% in August 2024 and recovering from a negative 0.3% in July 2025. On an annual basis, core inflation dropped to 10.7% in August from 11.6% the previous month.
The CBE forecasts that headline inflation will average between 14 and 15% for the full year, in line with its decline to 15.2% in the second quarter of 2025, down from 16.5% in the first quarter.
In light of the easing inflationary trend, the CBE’s Monetary Policy Committee decided on 28 August to cut key interest rates by 200 basis points. The overnight deposit rate now stands at 22%, the overnight lending rate at 23%, and both the credit and discount rate and the main operation rate at 22.5%.
According to the committee, the decision reflects its assessment of recent inflation developments and projections since its last meeting on 10 July. The CBE stated that demand-side inflationary pressures are expected to remain limited, supported by tight monetary policy and consistent with the short-term downward trend in inflation.
The bank reiterated its commitment to returning inflation to its target range of 7% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2026, and further to 5% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2028. However, it warned that inflation remains subject to upside risks, including changes in administratively set prices and rising geopolitical tensions in the region.
The CBE noted that the interest rate cut is consistent with maintaining a policy stance that anchors expectations and supports the anticipated disinflation path. It emphasized that the pace of monetary easing will be determined on a meeting-by-meeting basis, based on updated forecasts, economic data, and associated risks. The bank added that it will continue to closely monitor economic and financial conditions and use all available tools to ensure price stability and guide inflation toward its medium-term targets.",365,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9423425197601318,2025-12-08T21:31:59.571455
2025-12-07,Egypt launches initiative to transform petroleum waste into value-added resources,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/egypt-launches-initiative-to-transform-petroleum-waste-into-value-added-resources/,"Egypt’s Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy, Mahmoud Esmat, and Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Karim Badawi, witnessed on Sunday the signing of a cooperation protocol aimed at transforming petroleum-sector waste into value-added resources. The signing took place at the Electricity Ministry’s headquarters in the New Capital.
The agreement forms part of a broader state strategy to strengthen coordination between key authorities and ensure the efficient management of natural resources in a way that maximises economic returns.
The protocol, signed between the Nuclear Materials Authority and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), covers the treatment of technically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material (TE-NORM) generated by petroleum activities. It aims to ensure safe handling, treatment, and disposal in line with national and international environmental and health standards.
The agreement was signed by Hamed Meira, Chair of the Nuclear Materials Authority, on behalf of the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy, and Salah El-Din Abdelkarim, EGPC CEO, representing the Ministry of Petroleum.
Under the protocol, the Nuclear Materials Authority will be responsible for the treatment of petroleum waste including sediments, produced water, sludge, and other by-products—whether currently accumulated at sector sites or generated in the future. The Authority will conduct surveys and environmental assessments, prepare safe disposal and treatment plans, apply best-available technologies, and issue regular progress reports.
EGPC, meanwhile, will identify waste sites, types, and quantities, prepare technical reports, provide samples for analysis, and offer technical and logistical support to facilitate field surveys and assessments.
The cooperation supports the two ministries’ joint work plan to maximise returns from raw materials and extract valuable elements, especially rare minerals.
Esmat highlighted ongoing efforts to enhance the value of Egypt’s natural resources and the presidential directives to accelerate their optimal utilisation. He underscored the importance of providing the necessary technical capabilities and adhering to licensing, monitoring, and safety standards, alongside establishing joint technical committees to oversee implementation.
For his part, Badawi described the protocol as a strong model of integration between the petroleum and electricity sectors. He stressed that the petroleum sector’s expanding activities must go hand-in-hand with environmental protection, consistent with the ministry’s strategy that prioritises safety, emissions reduction, and sustainable resource management.
He added that proper waste treatment and recycling help transform waste into economic opportunities while advancing the environmental sustainability of petroleum and mining operations.",385,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.619785726070404,2025-12-08T21:32:04.839255

Hossam Heiba, CEO of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI), made the comments during the main session of the Egypt-Gulf Trade and Investment Forum in Cairo.
“The government aims for Egypt to be a regional centre in specific sectors where it has a high competitive advantage, primarily energy, tourism, and industry,” Heiba said. “GAFI has prepared its promotional plan to contribute to achieving these goals, and we have succeeded in attracting Arab and foreign investments in these sectors.”
Heiba reviewed the legislative and procedural amendments launched by the government to improve the investment environment since the 2017 investment law. He noted that GAFI has moved to the electronic establishment of companies and the digitalisation of services provided to investors.
“The successful Arab investor in Egypt is the most important element of promotion for the Egyptian economy, so the expansions of current investors receive the same incentives granted to new investments,” he added.

After months of slowing inflation and signs of macroeconomic stability, there is now a near-consensus among experts and investment banks that the CBE will reduce its key policy rates by between 1% and 2%.

Global context
Looking ahead
The upcoming decision comes at a critical juncture for Egypt’s economy. Policymakers are seeking to sustain the progress achieved in curbing inflation while simultaneously laying the groundwork for stronger private sector activity, investment inflows, and growth momentum. The debate now centres not on whether rates will be cut, but by how much — and how rapidly the easing cycle will unfold in the months ahead.
At its last meeting on 10 July, the MPC opted to keep its key rates unchanged: 24% for overnight deposits, 25% for overnight lending, and 24.5% for both the credit and discount rate and the main operation rate. That pause followed two successive rate cuts earlier in the year: a 225-basis-point reduction on 17 April and a further 100 basis points on 22 May.
In its July communiqué, the Committee explained that maintaining rates was “preferable” in order to allow time to assess the effects of new fiscal measures — including amendments to the value-added tax law and changes in administered prices — on inflationary dynamics. The MPC underscored that its decisions would continue to be data-dependent and conditional on the inflation outlook, potential risks, and external developments.
Inflation picture: A steady decline
Latest figures suggest that inflationary pressures have been easing consistently since the start of the year.
Core inflation
, as measured by the CBE, stood at 11.6% in July, up slightly from 11.4% in June but still well below last year’s peaks. On a monthly basis, core consumer prices actually declined by 0.3% in July, compared to a 0.2% decline in June.
Urban headline inflation
, published by CAPMAS, fell to 13.9% in July from 14.9% in June. The monthly urban CPI contracted by 0.5% in July after a 0.1% drop in June — further evidence that disinflationary forces are gaining strength.
The CBE projects that annual headline inflation will remain broadly stable at current levels for the rest of 2025 before resuming a gradual decline in 2026, converging towards the medium-term target of 7% (±2%) on average in Q4 2026. Much of this trajectory hinges on the impact of non-food price adjustments, global commodity trends, and fiscal consolidation measures.
Mohamed Abdel Aal
Expert views: Divided between 1% and 2% cuts
Banking veteran Mohamed Abdel Aal expects the MPC to opt for a 200-basis-point cut, resuming the easing cycle after July’s pause.
“Both headline and core inflation have now stabilised — at 13.9% and 11.6% respectively — largely due to lower food and beverage prices, which offset pressures from non-food inflation linked to administered price adjustments,” he said.
According to Abdel Aal, external disinflationary forces are reinforcing the trend. “Global declines in raw materials and imported goods prices are cushioning the domestic impact of subsidy rationalisation and higher VAT. This will likely allow inflation to continue falling through year-end.”
He argued that the CBE now has space to reduce rates without jeopardising stability:
Macroeconomic indicators remain broadly stable.
Global geopolitical tensions have eased somewhat.
Real interest rates have widened to levels that risk stifling private sector recovery.
“By year-end, I expect a total of 400 basis points in cumulative cuts, bringing the key rate closer to 20%,” Abdel Aal said. “A 200-basis-point cut would send the right signal.”
Still, he cautioned that the MPC could decide to remain conservative, particularly if it wishes to gauge the effects of customs duties or renewed regional instability.
Furthermore, HC Securities’ research team also forecasts a 2% cut, pointing to improved external indicators.
Macroeconomic analyst Heba Mounir highlighted several stabilising factors:
The Egyptian pound has appreciated around 5% year-to-date.
Egypt’s one-year credit default swap (CDS) spread has narrowed, signalling reduced sovereign risk.
Workers’ remittances have increased, bolstering FX inflows.
Net international reserves have expanded, providing a stronger buffer.
The banking system’s net foreign asset position has improved.
In parallel, Egypt’s domestic debt market continues to attract foreign participation. The latest 12-month Treasury bill auction cleared at 26.08%, equivalent to a positive real yield of 6.66% (after tax, based on HC’s inflation estimate).
“Despite expectations of rising energy costs, the MPC has room to cut rates by 200 basis points,” Mounir argued. “Slowing inflation, stronger external accounts, and the appreciation of the pound all strengthen the case.”
In contrast, banking analyst Shaimaa Wagih believes the MPC will prefer a more measured approach — a 100-basis-point cut.
“The CBE must strike a delicate balance: supporting growth while ensuring financial stability,” she said. “Inflation has slowed, but risks remain from Egypt’s foreign currency financing needs and potential capital outflows if yields fall too quickly.”
She noted that:
A gradual 1% cut would help ease borrowing costs for businesses and households without creating undue pressure on the pound.
Cheaper credit would boost investment, lending, and liquidity in the stock market.
The government would benefit from lower debt servicing costs, freeing fiscal space for social and developmental spending.
However, she cautioned that overly aggressive cuts could deter foreign investors in Treasury bills and bonds. “Capital flows need close monitoring,” she stressed. “A cautious pace avoids the risk of inflationary rebound.”
For Wagih, the most “professional” scenario is therefore a modest 100-basis-point cut that signals commitment to easing without triggering instability.

Market surveys: Consensus on cuts
Two major international surveys reinforce expectations of a rate reduction:
A
Reuters poll
of economists found consensus around a 100-basis-point cut at Thursday’s meeting, aimed at supporting growth amid declining inflation.
A
Bloomberg survey
of eight investment banks reached a similar conclusion, with most forecasting at least a 100-basis-point cut. Only two institutions anticipated rates remaining unchanged.
Among the banks participating in the surveys were EFG Holding, Naeem, Zeila Capital, CI Capital, Ahli Pharos, Prime, Mubasher Financial Services, Thndr, Cairo Capital, and Arabia Online.

Implications for the economy
1. Private sector revival
Lower interest rates would reduce financing costs for businesses, encouraging investment and expansion. This is particularly important for Egypt’s manufacturing and SME sectors, which have been squeezed by years of tight monetary conditions.
2. Banking sector dynamics
While banks could face narrower margins on interest spreads, this may be offset by stronger lending volumes. Retail credit — from mortgages to consumer loans — is likely to benefit, while corporate borrowing could regain momentum.
3. Capital markets boost
The stock market could see renewed liquidity as investors rebalance portfolios away from short-term debt instruments. Historically, rate cuts have been accompanied by rallies in equities, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and banking.
4. Fiscal relief
Lower rates would ease the government’s debt servicing burden. With debt costs consuming a significant portion of expenditure, even a modest reduction could free resources for public investment, infrastructure, and social protection.
5. Risks to manage
The main risks lie in external financing and the pound’s stability. A sudden outflow of foreign portfolio investment or a spike in energy import costs could put pressure on the exchange rate. This explains why some analysts favour gradualism over aggressive cuts.
Global context
Egypt’s anticipated move comes amid a broader shift in emerging markets, where central banks are cautiously unwinding the steep hikes of the past two years. Brazil, Chile, and Hungary have all entered easing cycles, while Turkey and South Africa are expected to follow suit in late 2025.
At the same time, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have signalled that their tightening cycles are over, with markets pricing in potential rate cuts in early 2026. This global backdrop provides the CBE with some room to manoeuvre, as capital flows into emerging markets remain supportive.
Looking ahead
MPC decision will likely set the tone for monetary policy in the final quarter of 2025. If the CBE opts for a bolder 200-basis-point cut, it could signal an acceleration of the easing cycle. A more cautious 100-basis-point move, however, would suggest gradualism and careful calibration.
Either way, analysts agree that the trajectory is downward, with policy rates expected to decline by at least 300–400 basis points by year-end — provided inflation remains on its current disinflationary path.
The balancing act for Egypt’s policymakers is clear: continue to anchor inflation expectations while providing breathing space for the private sector and supporting growth. The choice between a 1% or 2% cut may be tactical — but the direction of travel is unmistakable.",1494,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.8442087173461914,2025-12-08T21:32:15.464469

These include a high-tech medical equipment financing product with flexible repayment plans suited to the operational dynamics of healthcare institutions, as well as dedicated financing programmes enabling doctors and pharmacists to establish or expand specialised clinics and medical centres. The bank will also introduce green financing bundles to support energy-efficiency initiatives and sustainable operations within healthcare facilities.
Kashmiry made her remarks during her participation in the second annual Healthcare Investment Summit, attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health and Population Khaled Abdel Ghaffar; Minister of Finance Ahmed Kouchouk; and Ghada Tawfik, Assistant Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt for Corporate Social Responsibility.
The summit addressed a wide range of themes, including government efforts to stimulate investment in healthcare services; emerging opportunities for investors amid economic recovery and state-led incentives; and the localisation of medical industries supported by exchange-rate stability. Discussions also covered mechanisms for enhancing healthcare capacity to meet rising demand while managing cost and pricing pressures, as well as pathways for strengthened cooperation among the public, private and banking sectors to elevate service quality nationwide. The event further examined the growing role of banks and financial institutions in delivering products that support the expansion and accessibility of healthcare services and drive investment in this high-potential sector.
Kashmiry emphasised that healthcare and medical services financing sits at the core of United Bank’s strategy to support sustainable economic and social development. This includes financing hospital expansions, specialised medical centres, diagnostic laboratories and pharmacies, through tailored solutions for SMEs and retail financing programmes designed Specifically for doctors and pharmacists. She also highlighted the bank’s support for medical technology companies, a segment that has seen significant growth over the past three years amid rising demand for expansion, modernisation and digital transformation across the sector.
She explained that United Bank’s healthcare financing strategy is built around three pillars: supporting the expansion and development of hospitals and medical centres—particularly in governorates with limited specialised services; advancing digital health transformation; and empowering medical professionals and healthcare entrepreneurs through customised SME financing programmes covering medical equipment, laboratories and pharmaceutical services.

2025-11-01,CBE projects inflation to average 10.5% in 2026 as economic recovery gains momentum,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/01/cbe-projects-inflation-to-average-10-5-in-2026-as-economic-recovery-gains-momentum/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has projected a continued decline in inflation over the next two years, with annual headline inflation expected to average 14.0% in 2025 and 10.5% in 2026, compared to 28.3% in 2024. The Bank anticipates inflation will gradually converge towards its target of 7% (±2%) on average by the fourth quarter of 2026, signalling steady progress toward price stability following two years of inflationary pressures.
In its Q3 2025 Monetary Policy Report, the CBE emphasised that while the disinflation trend remains broadly intact, it continues to face upside risks from both domestic and global fronts. These include a higher-than-expected passthrough from fiscal consolidation measures, global commodity price volatility, and potential geopolitical flare-ups that could disrupt trade and energy markets.
Monetary Policy Report: Anchoring Transparency and Expectations
The CBE’s latest report underscores its ongoing efforts to enhance monetary policy transparency and strengthen public confidence in its inflation-targeting framework. It presents a detailed analysis of global and domestic developments, shedding light on inflation dynamics, growth trends, and financial conditions shaping the Egyptian economy in the third quarter of 2025.
The report also provides an outlook section offering a forward-looking assessment of headline inflation and real economic activity. This analysis is supported by an evaluation of the prevailing balance of risks, ensuring a data-driven approach to policymaking and market guidance.
Additionally, the report includes three thematic boxes highlighting critical aspects of monetary policy conduct:
The Basic Institutional Design of an Inflation Targeting Regime, exploring the structural underpinnings of Egypt’s transition toward a full-fledged framework.
Headline vs. Core Inflation, analysing the interplay between the two indicators and their implications for policy calibration.
Economic Activity and Employment: Does Okun’s Law Hold for Egypt?, which examines the empirical relationship between output and employment in the Egyptian context.
Economic Outlook: Growth Gathers Pace
Real GDP growth is expected to strengthen in the coming fiscal years, with projections of 4.8% in FY 2025/26 and 5.1% in FY 2026/27, according to the CBE. This acceleration will be driven primarily by robust performance in key sectors such as manufacturing, extractions, and services, alongside progress in monetary easing that is expected to bolster real private-sector credit growth.
The forecast also factors in a gradual recovery in Suez Canal revenues, underpinned by the expected normalisation of maritime activity in the Red Sea following the recent Gaza armistice. The CBE projects that the output gap will continue to narrow over the forecast horizon, with overall output levels approaching their potential by the end of FY 2025/26 — an indicator of a healthier, more balanced economy.
Global Developments: Moderating Inflation and Renewed Capital Flows
Globally, economic growth continued to recover in the second quarter of 2025 and is anticipated to maintain its momentum in the third quarter, albeit at a slower pace. This expansion is largely driven by emerging market economies, while developed markets exhibit moderate growth amid cautious monetary easing.
Global inflation has been moderating steadily, approaching central banks’ target ranges as commodity prices—particularly energy and food—have continued to ease. Energy prices stabilised, while international food prices declined for the fourth consecutive month through September 2025.
Improving inflation dynamics prompted central banks in both advanced and emerging economies to cautiously advance their monetary easing cycles, leading to more accommodative global financial conditions. This shift has resulted in a notable increase in capital inflows to emerging markets, including Egypt, where investor sentiment has been further reinforced by improving macroeconomic fundamentals and progress on structural reforms.
Egypt’s Sovereign Rating Upgraded by S&P
In a significant vote of confidence, S&P Global Ratings upgraded Egypt’s long-term sovereign credit rating from ‘B-’ to ‘B’ in October 2025, reflecting enhanced confidence in the country’s economic outlook. The upgrade was supported by the continued implementation of reform measures, stronger real growth, and improving external sector indicators, including rising reserves and healthier balance-of-payments dynamics.
The agency also noted Egypt’s commitment to fiscal discipline and the CBE’s effective inflation management, which together contribute to a more sustainable macroeconomic trajectory. The rating upgrade is expected to further reduce Egypt’s borrowing costs in international markets and enhance its attractiveness to portfolio and direct investors.
Domestic Developments: Inflation Eases and Growth Broadens
Domestically, the inflation outlook has shown clear signs of improvement. Annual headline inflation decelerated to an average of 12.5% in Q3 2025, compared to 15.2% in Q2, driven largely by a pronounced decline in food inflation, which has now reverted to pre-2022 levels.
Core inflation also moderated to 11.2%, down from 11.6% in the previous quarter, reflecting lower cost pressures and an easing in supply chain disruptions. Nonetheless, non-food inflation remained relatively persistent, fuelled by higher service costs—particularly rents—and moderate adjustments in administered prices.
The CBE’s nowcast for Q3 2025 signals a continued recovery in economic activity, with quarterly growth expected to hover around 5%. Key growth drivers include non-petroleum manufacturing, tourism, and the Suez Canal, which have all shown robust post-crisis recoveries.
Real Sector Performance and Demand Dynamics
Egypt’s real GDP at market prices expanded by 5.0% in Q2 2025, marking the fastest growth since early 2022. This strong performance lifted FY 2024/25 growth to 4.4%, up sharply from 2.4% in the previous year.
The rebound was primarily fuelled by higher private consumption and gross domestic investment, particularly in construction, manufacturing, and technology-driven sectors. The CBE expects demand-side inflationary pressures to remain contained, supported by the prevailing monetary policy stance and the projected path of the output gap.
Labour Market Trends and Wage Developments
In the labour market, real wages recorded positive growth for the fourth consecutive quarter during Q2 2025. While this improvement reflects a gradual recovery in household purchasing power, wage levels remain below their 2022 averages, suggesting limited inflationary pressure from the wage channel. Employment growth was strongest in manufacturing, logistics, and tourism—sectors that have benefited most from renewed investment and demand recovery.
External Sector: Current Account Improves and Reserves Strengthen
The current account deficit narrowed by 41% year-on-year in Q2 2025, driven by sustained increases in workers’ remittances, tourism receipts, and transport revenues, particularly from the Suez Canal. However, this improvement was partly offset by a wider hydrocarbon trade deficit, due to higher natural gas imports to meet local consumption needs.
Meanwhile, the financial account surplus remained robust, underpinned by continued foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows sufficient to cover the current account deficit. Consequently, Egypt’s overall balance of payments registered only a marginal deficit of $0.2bn in Q2 2025—a marked improvement over previous quarters.
On the monetary front, M2 money supply growth continued to slow, averaging 22.6% in Q3 2025, compared to 24.2% in Q2, reflecting tighter liquidity management and declining inflation expectations.
Monetary and Financial Conditions
The CBE reported a substantial improvement in net foreign assets (NFAs) within the banking system, which increased by $3bn between June and August 2025 to reach $17.9bn. This gain was primarily driven by commercial banks’ improved foreign exchange positions, sustained remittance inflows, and renewed portfolio investments.
Private-sector credit also expanded strongly, with local currency loans growing by 14.5% in Q3 2025, up from 12.6% in the previous quarter. The expansion reflects stronger credit demand and improving business confidence, supported by the CBE’s gradual monetary easing cycle, which saw cumulative policy rate cuts of 625 basis points in 2025.
The Bank noted that approximately 97% of policy rate cuts were transmitted to the interbank market, where the overnight rate averaged 23.6% in Q3 2025, down from 27.5% in Q1, confirming effective policy transmission.
Financial Markets and Sovereign Yields
Egyptian Eurobond yields declined by an average of 66 basis points in Q3 2025, continuing their downward trajectory since the start of FY 2024/25. This reflects more accommodative global financial conditions, declining sovereign risk, and a more sustainable macroeconomic position.
Improved investor confidence, combined with the sovereign rating upgrade and stronger fundamentals, is expected to further ease external financing pressures and support capital inflows into Egypt’s debt and equity markets over the medium term.
Optimistic outlook
The CBE’s latest projections signal a cautiously optimistic outlook for Egypt’s economy. With inflation on a downward path, growth gaining momentum, and external accounts improving, macroeconomic stability appears to be gradually taking hold.
Nevertheless, the Bank emphasises that continued structural reforms, fiscal discipline, and geopolitical stability will be essential to sustain this progress and reinforce resilience against external shocks.
If current trends persist, 2026 could mark a turning point for Egypt—ushering in a new phase of stable growth, anchored inflation, and renewed investor confidence in the country’s long-term prospects.",1406,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.7168768644332886,2025-12-08T21:32:21.152146
2025-11-22,Inflation-related risks necessitate cautious monetary-easing approach: CBE,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/22/inflation-related-risks-necessitate-cautious-monetary-easing-approach-cbe/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has cautioned that persistent inflation-related risks necessitate a prudent approach to the ongoing monetary easing cycle.
During its meeting last Thursday, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the CBE’s key policy rates unchanged — maintaining the overnight deposit rate at 21%, the overnight lending rate at 22%, and both the main operation rate and the credit and discount rate at 21.5%. These rates represent the main benchmark for short-term interest movements on the Egyptian pound.
The decision was widely anticipated by economists and investment banks.
So far this year, the CBE has cut interest rates by a cumulative 6.25%, with reductions of 2.25% in April, 1% in May, 2% in August and 1% in October.
In its accompanying statement, the MPC said the decision reflects its assessment of the latest inflation data and expectations since its previous meeting.
Globally, the Committee noted that indicators point to a continued recovery in economic activity, although global forecasts remain clouded by uncertainty over trade policies and persistent geopolitical tensions. Against this backdrop, central banks in advanced and emerging economies have generally taken a cautious stance in easing monetary policy.
On commodity markets, it said oil prices have been broadly stable, while many agricultural commodity prices have retreated. Nonetheless, upside risks to inflation remain, particularly the possibility of renewed disruptions to global supply chains.
Domestically, the MPC said the CBE’s estimates point to a slight improvement in economic growth, with real GDP expanding by 5.2% in the third quarter (Q3) 2025 compared with 5.0% in Q2. This acceleration was supported by strong performance in non-oil manufacturing, trade and tourism. The Committee added that output is expected to continue approaching full capacity, which is anticipated to be reached by the end of fiscal year 2025/2026.
Unemployment rose marginally to 6.4% in Q3 2025, from 6.1% in the previous quarter.
Regarding inflation, the MPC reported that the annual headline inflation rate increased to 12.5% in October 2025 from 11.7% in September. Core inflation also rose, reaching 12.1% in October compared with 11.3% a month earlier. It added that monthly inflation deviated from its typical seasonal pattern due to higher non-food prices — particularly services — which offset the impact of slowing food inflation.
The Committee stressed that further moderation in monthly inflation dynamics is needed for headline inflation to converge toward the CBE’s target.
It added that inflation expectations remain exposed to both global and domestic upside risks, including any escalation in geopolitical tensions, the persistence of services inflation, and fiscal consolidation measures that may exceed earlier projections.
Given these risks, the MPC said it must closely monitor inflation developments and their implications for the outlook, underscoring the need for caution in the monetary easing cycle.
The Committee said it therefore opted for a wait-and-see approach by holding policy rates steady, viewing this stance as appropriate for containing inflationary pressures, anchoring expectations and returning inflation to its downward path.
It reiterated that it will continue to assess its policy decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis, guided by expectations, risk assessments and incoming data. The CBE added that it stands ready to deploy all available tools to achieve price stability and steer inflation toward its target of 7% (± 2%) on average in Q4 2026.",545,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8376665115356445,2025-12-08T21:32:24.060417
2025-10-18,We look forward to expanding US investments in Egyptian economy: Kouchouk,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/18/we-look-forward-to-expanding-us-investments-in-egyptian-economy-kouchouk/,"Finance Minister Ahmed Kouchouk affirmed Egypt’s commitment to strengthening the participation and investments of American companies in the Egyptian economy amid improving macroeconomic indicators.
Speaking at a meeting with the American Chamber of Commerce on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings in Washington, D.C., Kouchouk said Egypt’s economy is growing steadily and encouragingly, supported by a strong, diverse, and dynamic private sector operating within a more competitive business environment.
He highlighted the government’s ongoing economic and fiscal reforms, along with tax and customs facilitation measures designed to attract further private investment.
“We are continuing along a path of trust and partnership with the business community through pragmatic and flexible approaches to tax challenges,” Kouchouk said. “Our commitment is to drive growth through a more inclusive and sustainable vision, centred on a healthy, private sector–led economy focused on manufacturing and exports.”
The minister noted that preliminary indicators for the first quarter of the current fiscal year point to balanced and stable financial performance, with a primary surplus exceeding EGP 170 billion, declining government debt, and strong growth in tax revenues — driven by an expanded tax base and improved relations with taxpayers.
Kouchouk emphasised that Egypt’s reform programme continues to progress positively, reflected in improved perceptions among investors, markets, and international rating agencies. He said Egypt has also shared details of its recent fiscal and structural reforms with the IMF, demonstrating the success of the previous fiscal year’s outcomes.
He revealed that Egypt’s privatisation and public offering programme will, for the first time, open new sectors to private and foreign investors — including airports, insurance, and telecommunications. The government is also assessing financial and non-financial incentives to encourage companies to list on the Egyptian Exchange (EGX) and increase trading volumes, he added, noting that the Egyptian market has the capacity to attract hundreds of new private firms with strong investment returns.
Addressing the role of technology, Kouchouk underscored the transformative impact of electronic tax systems in simplifying compliance and expanding the taxpayer base. “Automation has enabled us to build a more transparent, trustworthy, and predictable relationship with the tax community,” he said during a panel discussion on digital transformation in tax administration held as part of the IMF and World Bank meetings.
He added that digitising and streamlining procedures reduces the cost of voluntary compliance and attracts new taxpayers, while ensuring technological solutions are effectively employed to enhance services and protect taxpayer rights.
Kouchouk also highlighted the ministry’s efforts to develop skilled human capital capable of managing advanced digital systems, alongside establishing continuous communication channels with the tax community to explain ongoing reforms and their long-term benefits.",440,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9441251754760742,2025-12-08T21:32:28.004195
