2025-12-07,Egypt’s net international reserves rise to $50.215bn in November,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/egypts-net-international-reserves-rise-to-50-215bn-in-november/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) announced that the country’s net international reserves increased to $50.215bn in November 2025, up from $50.071bn in October, a rise of $144.4m.
The CBE noted that gold holdings within the reserves climbed to $17.252bn in November, compared to $16.545bn the previous month, marking an increase of $798m. Meanwhile, the value of foreign currencies in the reserves declined to $32.905bn, down from $33.350bn in October, a drop of $445m. Holdings of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) also fell to $61m, from $179m, reflecting a decrease of $118m.
Egypt’s foreign exchange reserves comprise a basket of major international currencies, including the US dollar, euro, pound sterling, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. The allocation of these holdings is determined by exchange-rate movements and the relative stability of each currency in global markets, and is adjusted according to a strategy set by CBE officials.
The primary role of the reserves, made up of gold and foreign currencies, is to secure essential imports, meet external debt obligations, and provide a buffer during economic shocks, particularly when foreign-currency-generating sectors come under pressure.
Global ratings agency Fitch has projected that Egypt’s reserves will reach $52.6bn by the end of the current fiscal year, after hitting a record $50.1bn in October.
In a recent report, Fitch noted a significant uptick in portfolio investment since last August, driven by attractive yields, which has supported the pound’s improved performance against the US dollar. The agency expects the pound to maintain its strong trajectory into 2026, highlighting that net foreign assets in the banking sector reached their highest level since February 2020 as of October 2025.
While Fitch anticipates further interest-rate cuts by the CBE in the coming months, it said Egyptian bond yields are likely to remain appealing to investors.
“The improvement in the external sector will persist,” the agency added. “The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 3% of GDP in 2025/2026, supported by higher exports of goods and services and robust remittances from Egyptians working abroad.”",335,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9101063013076782,2025-12-08T21:28:39.786158
2025-12-08,"Egypt, France discuss ways to advance investment cooperation, streamline customs procedures",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/08/egypt-france-discuss-ways-to-advance-investment-cooperation-streamline-customs-procedures/,"The General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) held an expanded meeting with French Ambassador to Egypt Éric Chevallier and Egyptian Customs Authority Chairperson Ahmed Amoui, bringing together senior French officials and representatives of French companies operating in the Egyptian market to discuss ways to strengthen investment cooperation and improve the business environment.
The meeting included the participation of Pascal Forêt, Head of the Economic Department at the French Embassy in Cairo; Christelle Labernède, Country Director of Business France in Egypt; Laurent Pasquier, Regional Customs Attaché; and Mohamed Saad, Head of the Egypt branch of French Foreign Trade Advisors.
The discussions come within the framework of Egypt’s efforts to enhance the investment climate, modernise its regulatory environment, and attract further foreign direct investment.
Hossam Heiba, CEO of GAFI, underscored the important role of French investments in supporting Egypt’s economic growth, highlighting the continued expansion and diversification of French companies across the industrial and service sectors. Heiba noted that the government is implementing wide-ranging reforms to modernise the customs system, including accelerating pre-clearance procedures, expanding digital platforms, improving valuation methods, and reducing release times—measures that strengthen Egypt’s competitiveness and facilitate trade flows.
He emphasised that French investors can benefit from GAFI’s Permanent Unit for Investor Problem-Solving and the Investor Dispute Resolution Centre, which provide swift and effective mechanisms to address challenges and stabilise investment activities. Heiba added that the meeting marks the start of a regular dialogue platform between GAFI, the French Embassy, and French companies to discuss constraints and enhance the overall business environment.
For his part, Ambassador Chevallier reiterated France’s commitment to advancing economic and investment cooperation with Egypt, stressing that French companies are longstanding partners in supporting the Egyptian economy and expanding opportunities across multiple sectors. He added that periodic meetings between both sides provide an important avenue for exchanging expertise, addressing bottlenecks, and streamlining procedures for French investors.
Customs Authority Chairperson Ahmed Amoui presented the key customs reforms underway, particularly in simplifying procedures, expanding digital infrastructure, and accelerating trade flows in line with international best practices, ultimately improving services provided to investors.
A dedicated discussion session followed, during which representatives of French companies raised customs-related challenges and supply-chain issues, and explored opportunities to support the expansion and stability of French investments in Egypt. Participating companies included leading players in the automotive, energy, food, logistics, biotechnology, aviation, sports, and hospitality sectors, among them Valeo, Air Liquide, Bel, CMA CGM, bioMérieux, Dassault, SCAT, Decathlon, and Groupe Barrière.
Both sides concluded the meeting by expressing their commitment to continued coordination and joint work, affirming that constructive dialogue between Egyptian government institutions and French businesses is vital to supporting the investment community, facilitating smoother procedures, and strengthening economic ties between Egypt and France.",453,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7004396915435791,2025-12-08T21:29:08.690819

, although
the police force remains the sector perceived as most corrupt, a Transparency International Pakistan survey showed on Tuesday.
The National Corruption Perception Survey (
NCPS
) 2025 indicated that nearly 60% of respondents fully or partially agreed that the government had successfully stabilised the economy through its International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and by exiting the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list.
Furthermore, 66% of respondents stated they did not encounter a situation in the last 12 months where they felt compelled to pay a bribe to access public services.
Methodology and Scope
The survey, conducted from Sept. 22 to Sept. 29, 2025, expanded its sample size to 4,000 respondents across 20 districts. The exercise included urban and rural populations, persons with disabilities, and transgender persons to provide a more representative snapshot of public sentiment.
Transparency International Pakistan noted that the NCPS measures public “mood” and experiences rather than certifying actual corruption levels or investigating specific cases. As a domestic exercise, the findings do not alter Pakistan’s standing on the global Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI).
Sector Rankings and Improvements
While the police sector remained the
highest ranked
for perceived corruption at 24%,
the
figure reflected a 6% improvement in public perception
regarding
behaviour and service delivery.
Other institutions showing improved public perception included education, land and property, local government, and taxation.
Following the police, tendering and procurement ranked second at 16%, while the judiciary placed third at 14%.
Despite the acknowledgement of macroeconomic stabilisation, 57% of respondents reported that their purchasing power had decreased over the past year.
Institutional Reform and Accountability
The report highlighted a strong public demand for reform within oversight bodies. An overwhelming 78% of Pakistanis said anti-corruption institutions, such as the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), should themselves be answerable and transparent.
Respondents prioritised better accountability (26%), limiting discretionary powers (23%), and stronger Right to Information laws (20%) as the most effective measures to curb corruption.
“The NCPS 2025… highlights how people perceive and experience [corruption] in their daily interactions with public institutions,” said Justice (R) Zia Perwez, Chairman of Transparency International Pakistan.
Health and Political Finance
In the healthcare sector, Pakistanis outlined a blueprint for reform, favouring stricter controls on commissions paid by pharmaceutical companies to doctors (23%) and a ban on private practice by public sector doctors (20%).
Regarding political finance, a combined 83% of respondents supported either banning or strictly regulating business funding to political parties. Additionally, 55% supported a complete ban on the use of political parties’ names and leadership images in government advertisements.
The survey also found that 42% of Pakistanis would feel safe reporting corruption if strong whistleblower protection laws were in place, emphasising the need for anonymity and reward mechanisms.",479,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.5862776041030884,2025-12-08T21:29:14.016829

Korea hold meeting to tackle investment challenges, deepen economic cooperation",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/01/egypt-s-korea-hold-meeting-to-tackle-investment-challenges-deepen-economic-cooperation/,"Egypt’s General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) convened the inaugural meeting of the Egyptian-Korean Business and Investment Development Committee, with the participation of GAFI CEO Hossam Heiba and Hyundo Yi, Commercial Attaché at the South Korean Embassy in Cairo, alongside representatives from several Egyptian government bodies and major Korean companies operating in the country.
The launch of the committee reflects Egypt’s commitment, through the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade and GAFI, to strengthening its economic partnership with South Korea and resolving challenges facing Korean investors. The platform aims to create a more attractive and stable investment climate through direct dialogue between government institutions and the Korean business community.
During the meeting, Heiba emphasised that cooperation with South Korea is a key pillar of Egypt’s strategy to reinforce economic ties. He highlighted GAFI’s ongoing reforms to streamline procedures, accelerate licensing, and enhance investor services through the digitisation of all investment-related processes.
Heiba noted that GAFI is finalising a unified digital platform that will provide all investor services, including licences, approvals and electronic tracking of applications, designed to improve transparency, efficiency and reduce human intervention. He added that full procedural reengineering, carried out with an international-Egyptian consortium, will begin in January 2026. This includes expanding the “golden licence” system and improving customs clearance to boost the business environment and attract more foreign investment, particularly from South Korea.
Heiba underscored the importance of direct coordination with all relevant government entities to address challenges facing Korean companies in Egypt. He affirmed that GAFI is closely monitoring these issues and developing an executive plan to resolve them, with priority given to eliminating obstacles and ensuring systematic follow-up to support the expansion and sustainability of Korean investments.
For his part, Yi said the meeting reflects the growing mutual interest in advancing economic cooperation. He expressed appreciation for Egypt’s efforts and noted that many Korean companies are successfully operating across key sectors of the Egyptian market. He stressed the importance of addressing investor concerns and fostering a supportive environment for growth and expansion.
GAFI’s Investor Follow-up Department presented recent achievements in aftercare services and outlined executive measures taken to improve the business climate and streamline procedures. The overview reaffirmed the state’s commitment to supporting existing investors and facilitating their growth.
The meeting also featured an open discussion with Korean companies, led by the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA). Participating firms highlighted the key challenges they face in the Egyptian market, while representatives from GAFI, the Central Bank of Egypt, and the Customs and Tax Authorities responded to these concerns and explained available solutions—underscoring the state’s commitment to active engagement and rapid, systematic problem-solving.
Both sides expressed their desire for continued cooperation and regular coordination, agreeing that this constructive dialogue represents an important step toward supporting the business community and facilitating the flow of Korean investments into Egypt in a manner that serves the economic interests of both countries.
The meeting saw broad participation from major Korean companies involved in electronics, electrical industries, TV and mobile phone manufacturing, razor blade production, chemicals, steel, logistics, ready-made garments, power and telecom cables, and packaging materials. Companies operating in nuclear energy, natural resource development, international trade, and railway equipment design and manufacturing also took part, reflecting the depth and diversity of Korean interest in expanding investment cooperation with Egypt.",551,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8331554532051086,2025-12-08T21:29:19.229975
2025-08-30,CBE projects inflation to ease to 14–15% in 2025,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/08/30/cbe-projects-inflation-to-ease-to-14-15-in-2025/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) expects headline inflation to decline to between 14% and 15% in 2025, after slowing to 15.2% in the second quarter compared with 16.5% in the first. The projection was announced following the latest meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which cut key interest rates by two percentage points in a move intended to support the disinflationary trend.
The overnight deposit rate was lowered to 22%, the overnight lending rate to 23%, while both the main operation rate and the credit and discount rate were set at 22.5%. The MPC explained that the decision reflected its assessment of recent inflation developments and expectations, building on signs of easing pressures across the domestic economy.
Globally, recent months have seen a gradual recovery in growth alongside stabilising inflation expectations. This has encouraged central banks in advanced and emerging markets to ease monetary policy, albeit cautiously, given continuing uncertainty. Commodity markets remain mixed, with oil prices fluctuating due to supply dynamics, while agricultural prices have followed divergent paths. Despite these developments, risks to global growth and inflation persist, particularly from geopolitical tensions and disruptions to trade policy.
Domestically, preliminary CBE data suggest stronger-than-expected economic growth in the second quarter of 2025, supported mainly by non-oil manufacturing and tourism. Real GDP is now projected to expand by 5.4% in the quarter, with the fiscal year 2024/2025 expected to record average growth of 4.5%, compared with 2.4% in 2023/2024. Labour market conditions also improved, with unemployment falling to 6.1% in the second quarter, down from 6.3% in the first.
Inflation data show further signs of relief. Annual headline inflation slowed to 13.9% in July 2025, from 14.9% in June, while core inflation was broadly stable at 11.6% compared with 11.4% a month earlier. On a monthly basis, both headline and core inflation recorded negative rates in July, at -0.5% and -0.3% respectively, marking a second consecutive month of contraction. These negative monthly readings underline the easing of inflationary pressures and point to improved expectations, supported by monetary policy and more stable exchange rate conditions.
The CBE therefore expects inflation to average between 14% and 15% over the course of 2025, before gradually approaching its target range. According to the outlook, inflation is forecast to converge towards the CBE’s target of 7% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2026, and further towards 5% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2028.
Nevertheless, the MPC cautioned that the inflation path remains exposed to several upside risks. Chief among these are the possibility of administered price adjustments exceeding expectations, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions that could disrupt global supply chains and commodity markets.
Against this backdrop, the Committee judged that cutting policy rates by 200 basis points was appropriate to maintain a monetary stance that anchors expectations and supports the anticipated decline in inflation. The MPC stressed that future policy decisions will continue to be data-dependent, taken on a meeting-by-meeting basis, and guided by inflation expectations, risk assessments, and domestic and external developments.
The Committee reaffirmed its commitment to closely monitor economic and financial conditions and to deploy all available instruments to safeguard price stability.",523,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9495778679847716,2025-12-08T21:29:29.355972

2025-11-22,CBE outlines drivers behind October’s rise in inflation,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/22/cbe-outlines-drivers-behind-octobers-rise-in-inflation/,"Annual urban headline inflation accelerated to 12.5% in October 2025, up from 11.7% in September, according to data released by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE).
The CBE said the acceleration was primarily driven by higher services prices, especially imputed residential rents, in addition to an uptick in volatile food prices.
Non-food inflation rose to 20.4% in October, compared with 19.1% in September, while annual food inflation edged up slightly to 1.5%, from 1.4% a month earlier.
Annual core inflation also accelerated, reaching 12.1% in October 2025 from 11.3% in September. On a monthly basis, core inflation stood at 2% in October, compared with 1.3% in the same month last year.
The CBE noted that the October increase was mainly driven by a pickup in services inflation, led by a sharp 17.5% rise in imputed rents for housing.
Monthly urban headline inflation rose to 1.8% in October 2025, compared with 1.1% in October 2024. The monthly increase was largely attributable to higher prices of fresh vegetables and services, with retail goods also contributing to a lesser extent.
In rural areas, annual headline inflation decelerated to 7.8% in October, from 8.9% in September. Nationwide, annual headline inflation remained broadly stable at 10.1%, compared with 10.3% a month earlier.
Monthly food inflation reached 1.2% in October, contributing 0.5% to monthly headline inflation.
October’s food inflation was driven by:
A 5% increase in volatile food items, adding 0.32% to monthly headline inflation. While fresh fruit prices fell by 7.6%, fresh vegetables surged by 14.7%, both in line with typical seasonal patterns.
A 5% rise in egg prices, contributing 0.08%.
Monthly non-food inflation recorded 2.2% in October, contributing 1.38% to monthly headline inflation.
The CBE said the rise in non-food inflation was mainly due to:
A 4.5% increase in services prices, adding 1.25% to monthly headline inflation. This was largely driven by the 17.5% rise in imputed housing rents, which alone contributed 1.18%, alongside a slight increase in restaurant and café prices.
A 0.5% increase in retail items, contributing 0.07%, mainly due to slightly higher prices for clothing and footwear, cleaning products, and personal care items.
A 0.2% rise in regulated prices, contributing 0.05%, reflecting a 0.5% increase in tobacco prices and a 0.6% rise in LPG cylinder prices.
Monthly core inflation stood at 2% in October 2025, reflecting the combined impact of changes in core CPI components. Services accounted for 1.74% of the monthly core inflation rate, while core food and retail items contributed 0.20% and 0.10%, respectively.",415,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8845880627632141,2025-12-08T21:29:37.213040
2025-12-07,Egyptian developers offer unprecedented cash discounts amid mounting market pressures,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/egyptian-developers-offer-unprecedented-cash-discounts-amid-mounting-market-pressures/,"“It is impossible for residential unit prices to drop, unlike cars,” said Osama Saad, CEO of the Real Estate Development Chamber, as developers grapple with rising costs and shifting market conditions.
Saad explained that recent fluctuations in the exchange rate and construction material prices prompted a series of meetings with developers to explore potential price reductions. However, it was agreed that unit prices in projects where one or two phases have already been sold will remain unchanged. Instead, developers are offering additional in-kind benefits, such as upgraded finishing packages or contributions toward club memberships, to attract buyers without altering base prices.
In recent months, the market has seen cash payment discounts exceeding 50%, an unprecedented level for Egypt’s real estate sector. Several developers have introduced these aggressive offers to boost liquidity and maintain construction momentum amid rising costs and tightening financing conditions. Traditionally, cash discounts have ranged from 25% to 30%, but recent pressures have pushed them significantly higher.
In East Cairo, particularly the New Administrative Capital, Mostakbal City, and the Fifth Settlement, cash discounts ranged between 25% and 50%. In West Cairo, projects recorded discounts of around 30%. Madinet Masr stood out by offering what marketers say is the highest announced cash discount so far: 55% for immediate full payments.
Abdallah Sallam, President and CEO of Madinet Masr, said the company’s offers reflect current purchasing power and evolving customer preferences. Madinet Masr, he explained, continuously designs flexible payment plans tailored to diverse client segments. The current discount levels, he noted, align with prevailing interest rates and offer buyers a balanced financial alternative.
Sallam emphasised that upfront-payment incentives aim to stimulate demand and provide practical solutions in the current economic environment. These offers help companies reinforce cash flow, supporting construction and operational commitments. He added that such approaches bolster the appeal of real estate as a stable investment while ensuring Madinet Masr’s long-term financial and operational resilience.
However, not all industry voices are optimistic. Mohamed Samir, CEO of Elite Consulting, said the steep cash discounts signal mounting pressures in the market. He warned that the sector faces a “real crisis” that could intensify in the first and second quarters of 2026 due to liquidity shortages, slowing sales, and rising rates of unit returns.
Samir noted that Egypt lacks a robust mortgage financing system capable of supporting demand, leaving developers dependent on cash discounts to secure liquidity. Much of this cash, he added, is directed toward covering immediate financial obligations and completing ongoing projects. Access to bank financing remains limited, available only to a small number of large developers and often requiring lengthy processing times, which weakens financial sustainability across the sector.
He highlighted that 2022 and 2023 witnessed a surge in new project launches and strong sales, with many units scheduled for delivery in 2026. But current liquidity constraints and slowing sales could affect delivery timelines and challenge some developers’ ability to meet obligations to clients.
Abd Elrahman Abozeid, Senior Sales Team Leader at Taskeen, a subsidiary of Nawy specialising in proptech solutions, said the large cash discounts have generated “noticeable movement” in the real estate market in recent months. He noted that the offers have boosted demand for ready units and projects nearing completion. While upfront-payment discounts in such projects typically remain below 50%, they tend to increase as construction advances.
Abozeid added that the primary objective of these offers is to stimulate sales and secure the cash flow required to complete projects. Discount levels, he said, vary based on the size of the upfront payment and the conditions of each project.",593,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8838165998458862,2025-12-08T21:29:40.052171

This move is part of Egypt’s broader efforts to improve the business climate and offer more efficient, transparent services to investors.
The announcement followed the final meeting of the technical committee overseeing the review and update of the framework, chaired by GAFI CEO Hossam Heiba. The session also included key participants such as Dalia El-Hawary, Deputy CEO for Institutional Development, Research, and Economic Performance, along with experts from prominent Egyptian and international audit firms and relevant authorities.
The committee focused on streamlining accounting standards, improving procedures for mergers, demergers, and corporate restructurings, and reviewing the technical treatment of companies’ financial frameworks. Additionally, the committee developed a comprehensive approach for pre-investment financial reviews, aligning with international best practices while addressing practical challenges and proposing measures to support Egypt’s digital transformation.
CEO Hossam Heiba highlighted that the updated framework is crucial for strengthening Egypt’s investment environment. It will foster greater transparency, improve technical accuracy, and better meet investor needs. He also emphasized that GAFI’s ongoing modernization efforts aim to digitize services and enhance the quality of services in line with global standards and Egypt’s investment priorities.
“We will closely monitor the implementation of these reforms, gather stakeholder feedback, and continue making improvements,” said Heiba, stressing the importance of regular follow-up meetings to track progress and achieve long-term institutional impact.
El-Hawary added that the committee used an in-depth analytical approach, examining existing models and international case studies to develop actionable recommendations for improving valuation and financial review processes. She emphasized that the new framework will boost the reliability and consistency of valuation results across GAFI’s technical departments.
As part of its digital transformation initiative, GAFI also introduced a new online platform for financial review services. The platform allows investors to submit requests, track their status, and receive real-time updates and notifications, marking a significant shift toward greater digital integration and efficiency. This initiative aims to reduce review times, enhance transparency, and improve communication with investors.
GAFI stated that the updated framework and digital platform are part of a wider series of reforms designed to improve Egypt’s competitiveness, attract both domestic and foreign investment, and strengthen investor confidence. The authority is committed to closely monitoring these reforms to ensure their successful implementation and positive impact on the business community.",401,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.5446624159812927,2025-12-08T21:29:42.887197

sat down with Olivia Toderean, Ambassador of Romania to Egypt, to discuss the roadmap for this milestone. From unlocking trade potential and navigating regional geopolitical challenges to fostering a modern cultural dialogue, Ambassador Toderean shares her vision for a partnership that honors the past while aggressively pursuing the opportunities of the future.
Beyond the Celebration: Our nations are approaching a remarkable milestone: 120 years of continuous diplomatic relations. Your Excellency, the 120th anniversary is a powerful symbol. But to make it truly meaningful, it must be a catalyst for action. When you stand alongside your Egyptian counterparts on April 1, 2026, what specific, tangible outcome—be it a major trade agreement, a new investment project, or a strategic policy declaration—do you hope to announce that will define the next chapter of our relationship?
You are absolutely right, and I believe this is the approach both in Bucharest and in Cairo. While some of the preparations are too early to reveal, I can assure you they are substantial. It is clear that the 120th anniversary of Romanian–Egyptian diplomatic relations is not only a moment of celebration but also an excellent opportunity to project our partnership into the future.
Over the past century, our nations have built relations of trust, solidarity, and respect—from political dialogue to economic and cultural exchanges, as well as educational cooperation. Now, as we approach this milestone, our priority is to translate that history into new, tangible achievements. We would like the anniversary to be marked by more than symbolic gestures. Together with our Egyptian partners, we are working so that throughout 2026 we can announce a set of flagship outcomes that will truly define the next chapter of our relations.
Beyond government-to-government agreements, we also want this anniversary to bring benefits felt by our peoples. We are therefore paying close attention to fostering people-to-people contacts, cultural and academic partnerships, and opportunities for young generations to know and understand each other better.
In short, what matters most is that this anniversary should leave behind more than memories. It should create the foundation for new opportunities, sustainable development, innovation, and deepening the friendship that has linked Romania and Egypt for over a century. The fact that Romania will be the Guest of Honor at the Cairo International Book Fair 2026—a flagship cultural event that highlights the rich cultural tapestry of Egypt—is just one of the significant projects for 2026. We will bring numerous Egyptian and Romanian writers, cultural debates, workshops, and round tables to our national pavilion. I promise you there will be many pleasant surprises that will attract our Egyptian readers and expand the circles of our Egyptian friends.
Olivia Toderean
Reimagining the Pillars: For decades, this relationship was built on solid pillars: political solidarity, cultural exchange, and educational ties that saw thousands of Egyptians study in Romania. Looking forward, what do you believe should be the new pillars of the Egypt-Romania strategic relationship in the 21st century? Are they in energy, digital transformation, and logistics, or something else entirely?
Indeed, the traditional pillars of our bilateral relationship remain a living foundation that continues to inspire us today. However, in the 21st century, it is our duty to contextualize these pillars differently. The world around us is transforming at an unprecedented pace, and Romania and Egypt, both situated at geopolitical crossroads, have a special responsibility to adapt and innovate together.
Looking forward, we see
energy
—with a focus on renewables and the broader green transition—as a natural area of cooperation. Both Romania and Egypt are investing in sustainable energy solutions, and there is great potential to connect our efforts, whether in technology, innovation, investment, or joint projects that serve our citizens and contribute to climate resilience.
Logistics and connectivity
are another strategic field. Egypt plays a central role as a regional hub through the Suez Canal and its modernized ports, while Romania represents a gateway to the European Union, the Black Sea, and Eastern Europe.

Linking these advantages in a more systematic way could position our countries as essential partners in ensuring supply chain resilience between Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.
We are also convinced that
digital transformation
and the knowledge economy must be at the heart of the new agenda. Digital skills, artificial intelligence, and the integration of new technologies into health, education, and governance are areas where Romania has experience as a European IT hub, and where Egypt’s young and dynamic population offers extraordinary potential.
At the same time, I would emphasize that people-to-people connections will remain the soul of our relationship. The ties that once brought Egyptian doctors, engineers, and artists to study in Romania can now evolve into new forms of cooperation. So, to answer your question: the new pillars will certainly include energy, digital innovation, and connectivity, but they must also be complemented by the timeless human dimension—education, culture, and direct
Unlocking Trade Potential: Our bilateral trade is healthy, but many analysts believe it is performing below its potential. What are the key barriers preventing more Romanian companies from entering the Egyptian market, and how can we better position Egyptian exports to find a home in Romania and the wider EU market?
You are right to point out that our bilateral trade, while solid and growing, has not yet reached its full potential. I must recognize that the trend of 2024 was slightly disappointing compared to recent years, but in the first half of 2025, there seems to be a bounce back—I am eagerly looking forward to the figures at the end of this year.
The complementarities are evident: Romanian expertise in IT, cybersecurity, automotive components, and advanced agriculture pairs well with Egypt’s role as a manufacturing hub and a market of over 100 million people.
Barriers do exist, such as limited mutual visibility. Romanian SMEs may be unfamiliar with the Egyptian business culture, just as Egyptian exporters may find EU standards complex. We also need stronger logistical and financial connectivity. However, these are not structural roadblocks; they are challenges that can be addressed with targeted policies.
Regarding Egyptian exports, the answer lies in moving up the value chain. Beyond traditional goods, there is real potential for processed food products, textiles with higher value-added, chemicals, fertilizers, and renewable energy technologies. Romania, with its Black Sea ports and modern transport links into Central and Western Europe, can serve as an entry point for these Egyptian products into the EU single market.
The Energy Bridge: Black Sea to the Mediterranean: Romania is a significant energy producer in Europe. Egypt is positioning itself as a major regional energy hub for LNG and green hydrogen. How do you envision a strategic energy partnership between our two countries?
Energy is without a doubt one of the most promising areas of the Romanian–Egyptian partnership. There is an ongoing dialogue between EGAS and its Romanian counterpart, Transgaz, on joint projects of significance. CisGaz from Romania has developed a series of projects in partnership with Town Gas in Egypt, taking place in both countries. We are currently supporting other emerging projects in green energy, and hopefully, I will be able to share good news by next year in this field too.
Romania is already a significant energy producer in Europe. Except for peak periods in winter, we will be self-sufficient with a mix of green, nuclear, and gas-based production. Egypt has ambitious plans for green hydrogen and solar energy. We can certainly collaborate in energy engineering and technology, including offshore exploration.
Port to Port: Constanța and the Suez Canal: How can we create a more robust logistical and trade corridor between our key ports?
The Port of Constanța and the Suez Canal are not only vital for our respective countries but for global trade. If we think strategically, linking these two gateways more closely could create a powerful corridor between Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
I also see great potential in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE), a priority I am actively promoting to Romanian companies. For those seeking to expand into Africa and the Gulf, the SCZONE offers a unique platform. Positioning the zone as a natural destination for Romanian business—in industries ranging from agri-food to light manufacturing and IT—would give our partnership a tangible, future-oriented dimension.
A Bridge to Brussels: As an influential EU member state, how can Bucharest help shape a more nuanced and supportive EU policy toward Egypt?
Romania has always valued its role as a constructive bridge between the European Union and the wider Middle East. The context is very favorable to EU-Egypt relations—the only strategic and comprehensive partnership the EU has signed so far.
On water security and the Nile, Romania encourages dialogue that acknowledges Egypt’s vital interests. On regional stability, we promote balanced policies that reflect Egypt’s indispensable role in maintaining peace. This positioning was proven once again by the overwhelming majority of Romanian MPs who voted in favor of the European Parliament’s adoption of the €4 billion macro-financial assistance package for Egypt in April 2025.
The Ukraine War: What is your message to the Egyptian people about the resilience of the Black Sea grain corridor and Europe’s long-term strategy to ensure global food supply chains?
Romania has been at the frontline of the geopolitical and humanitarian crisis triggered by Russia’s war against Ukraine. To mitigate the dire consequences on food security, Romania took decisive steps to ensure that Ukrainian grain reaches global markets—over 50 million tons have transited our country. Moving from zero transit before the war to millions of tons per year was an enormous logistical challenge, but we remained committed.
At the same time, we are doing our own homework to increase our food exports. Keep in mind that Romania has been the 3rd largest exporter of wheat to Egypt in recent years, and we are actively working to enhance this market share.
The Gaza Crisis: What role can Romania play in supporting mediation and humanitarian relief?
Romania has always believed in dialogue, balance, and respect for international law. From Cairo, I have the privilege of listening closely to Egyptian interlocutors who are at the heart of mediation efforts. We support Egypt’s mediation role as indispensable.
Romania has supported the vision of two states—Israel and Palestine—living side by side in peace and security for decades. We also emphasize the humanitarian dimension. Romania has contributed aid and executed international evacuations to EU Member States for urgent medical cases, especially children. Around 50 children are currently being treated in Romanian hospitals, accompanied by approximately 100 family members.
Revitalizing Educational Ties: How can we revive and modernize the educational bridge between our nations?
We are actively encouraging stronger links between Romanian and Egyptian universities through joint research initiatives and double-degree programs. For example, there are new discussions between Alexandria University and Babeș-Bolyai University regarding a partnership.
Beyond traditional programs, Romania is exploring opportunities in online learning and tech incubators. A recent success is the training program organized by the Romanian Silver Screen Film School in partnership with the American University in Cairo. The first edition was a success, and I hope to see it grow, as the film and entertainment industry can bring significant economic growth.
Beyond Dracula and the Pyramids: How can our two countries foster a more contemporary cultural exchange?
Moving “beyond Dracula and the Pyramids” means embracing the full richness of who we are today. Romania hosts world-class festivals like the Sibiu International Theater Festival (FITS) and the Transylvania International Film Festival (TIFF). Likewise, Egypt is witnessing a flourishing of theater, cinema, and design.
We need to make sure our modern stories reach wider audiences. I was incredibly proud when a Romanian film won the supreme trophy at the Cairo International Film Festival last year. In essence, Romania and Egypt both have stories to tell that are as modern and dynamic as our relations are ancient.
Finally, Madam Ambassador, when you look back on your time in Cairo, what is the one human connection or diplomatic breakthrough you hope to have fostered?
This is perhaps the most difficult question. As I am only approaching the middle of my mandate, it is too early to speak of a diplomatic breakthrough in retrospect. I promise to answer this in a special interview with
Daily News Egypt
as I approach the end of my tenure!
As for the human connection, I can already say there isn’t just one, but many. I have made friendships here that have changed me and will remain with me for a lifetime. These connections span culture, science, business, and civil society. Even at mid-mandate, I can say without hesitation that the human connections I’ve made in Cairo have been one of the greatest pleasant surprises I have experienced, not only as an ambassador but as a person.",2180,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.6098382472991943,2025-12-08T21:29:50.553068
2025-12-06,US warns NATO allies against ‘bullying’ American defence firms amid protectionism row,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/06/us-warns-nato-allies-against-bullying-american-defence-firms-amid-protectionism-row/,"US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau has criticised European NATO allies for prioritising domestic defence companies over American suppliers, warning partners against “bullying” US firms or excluding them from the continent’s rearmament efforts.
According to diplomatic sources cited by
Politico
, Landau delivered the admonition during a closed-door meeting of NATO foreign ministers on Wednesday, urging allies to ensure American contractors are not shut out of the market as Europe moves to bolster its military industry.
The intervention comes amid heightened transatlantic tensions over trade and defence spending, with Washington increasingly wary of European Union initiatives designed to foster “sovereign” military capabilities.
A US State Department official confirmed the substance of Landau’s message, stating he conveyed two primary points: the need for Europe to convert defence spending pledges into tangible capabilities, and a warning that “protectionist and exclusionary policies that shut out US companies undermine our collective defence”.
The meeting marked the first time in over two decades that a US Secretary of State has missed a NATO ministerial gathering, with Marco Rubio absent from the talks.
Transatlantic Trade Tensions
Landau’s comments reflect a broader strategy by the current US administration to pressure historic partners on trade terms. President Donald Trump has frequently criticised the EU for “unfair” treatment of the United States, while the bloc has previously described Washington’s trade demands as tantamount to “blackmail”.
The dispute over defence procurement arises as NATO allies have pledged to spend 5 per cent of GDP on defence by 2035. Concurrently, the EU is allocating €150bn in defence grants for joint procurement, implementing strict controls that encourage intra-European purchasing and reduce reliance on third countries.
Despite the friction, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte noted on Wednesday that allies, including Canada and European nations, have pledged $4bn to a NATO-backed plan funding US defence firms to supply Ukraine.
US Dominance and Market Share
American defence contractors are seeking to secure their position in the European market, which accounts for approximately 11 per cent of annual revenue for major players such as Lockheed Martin and RTX.
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), US firms have strengthened their global foothold, capturing 43 per cent of arms exports over the past five years, up from 35 per cent in the previous period.
In Europe, reliance on American hardware remains high. SIPRI data indicates that arms imports by European NATO members more than doubled between the 2015–2019 and 2020–2024 periods. The US supplied 64 per cent of these weapons, a significant increase from 52 per cent previously.
Thirteen European nations, including Britain, Germany, and Italy, have procured or ordered US-made F-35 fighter jets. European armies have also bolstered stocks of RTX’s Patriot air defence systems and HIMARS rocket launchers.
To maintain market access, US firms are deepening ties with European counterparts. Lockheed Martin is establishing missile production lines with Germany’s Rheinmetall, while a joint venture between Raytheon and European missile maker MBDA will produce Patriot missiles in Germany.
European Industry Growth
Europe’s domestic defence sector is also expanding after years of underinvestment. The AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) reported that the sector grew by 13.8 per cent in 2024, generating revenues of €183.4bn ($213bn). Employment in the sector rose by 8.6 per cent to 633,000 jobs.
However, the ASD warned of persistent challenges, including supply chain bottlenecks, shortages of raw materials and electronic components, high energy costs, and labour market constraints.
Micael Johansson, ASD prominent figure and CEO of Saab, told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday that the continent must persist in building its own industrial base.
“We have to ensure that the defence industry continues to support the building of European sovereign capabilities that enhance deterrence and defence,” Johansson said. “That cannot stop just because a ceasefire is reached or negotiations begin.”",633,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.901171326637268,2025-12-08T21:29:55.887628
2025-10-13,S&P Global Ratings upgrade signals renewed confidence in Egypt’s economy: CBE Governor,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/13/sp-global-ratings-upgrade-signals-renewed-confidence-in-egypts-economy-cbe-governor/,"Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) Hassan Abdalla welcomed S&P Global Ratings’ decision to upgrade Egypt’s sovereign credit rating, describing it as a clear reflection of growing international confidence in the national economy. He attributed the move to the success of recent monetary and structural reforms implemented by the government and the CBE.
Abdalla highlighted that the unification of Egypt’s exchange rate regime marked a pivotal step towards restoring market stability and boosting investor confidence. He noted that the improvement in external sector indicators and the rise in foreign exchange reserves demonstrate the effectiveness of the economic policies currently in place.
The governor reaffirmed the CBE’s commitment to maintaining disciplined monetary policies aimed at containing inflation, safeguarding financial stability, and ensuring sustainable economic growth. These efforts, he said, have strengthened the trust of international institutions and investors in Egypt’s economic outlook.
On Friday, S&P Global Ratings upgraded Egypt’s long-term sovereign credit rating to “B” from “B-” with a stable outlook—the first such upgrade in seven years. The agency explained that the decision reflects Egypt’s reform momentum over the past 18 months, including the liberalisation of the foreign exchange regime, which has supported a strong rebound in GDP growth during fiscal year 2025.
S&P further noted that Egypt’s shift to a flexible exchange rate regime has bolstered economic resilience, contributing to higher tourism revenues, robust remittance inflows, and stronger net financial inflows—all of which have improved the country’s external position.
In a related development, Fitch Ratings affirmed Egypt’s long-term foreign-currency rating at ‘B’ with a stable outlook, citing resilient economic performance, improving external indicators, and continued fiscal reform efforts despite regional challenges.
Both assessments, Abdalla said, underscore the success of Egypt’s ongoing reform agenda and its ability to navigate global and regional headwinds while maintaining economic stability and growth momentum.",301,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9568681716918944,2025-12-08T21:30:00.275855
2025-10-04,"Inflation expectations still face upside risks domestically, globally: CBE",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/04/inflation-expectations-still-face-upside-risks-domestically-globally-cbe/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has stated that inflation expectations remain exposed to upside risks stemming from both domestic and global factors, including regulated price adjustments exceeding projections and rising geopolitical tensions in the region.
At its meeting last Thursday, the CBE’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to reduce the bank’s key policy rates by 1 percentage point, setting the overnight deposit rate at 21%, the overnight lending rate at 22%, and both the main operation rate and the discount rate at 21.5%.
In a statement following the meeting, the MPC said the decision reflects its assessment of the latest inflation developments and the evolving outlook since its previous meeting, noting that the move aims to sustain the disinflation process while maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Global Context: Gradual Easing and Stable Inflation Expectations
On the global front, the Committee observed that recent indicators point to a moderate recovery in growth, accompanied by stable inflation expectations. As a result, many central banks in advanced and emerging economies have continued to ease monetary policy gradually, responding to fast-changing global conditions.
Oil prices have largely remained stable, though some recent upward pressures have emerged due to supply factors. Meanwhile, agricultural commodity prices have exhibited mixed but limited movements.
Despite these stabilising trends, the MPC warned that global growth and inflation remain vulnerable to several risks — most notably the potential escalation of geopolitical tensions and ongoing uncertainty surrounding global trade policies.
Domestic Economy: Growth Accelerates but Remains Below Potential
Domestically, Egypt’s real GDP growth accelerated to 5% in the second quarter (Q2) of 2025, up from 4.8% in the previous quarter. Consequently, average growth for FY 2024/2025 reached 4.4%, compared with 2.4% in FY 2023/2024.
This improvement was primarily driven by non-oil manufacturing, tourism, and trade, which collectively supported the ongoing recovery in economic activity.
However, the MPC noted that output still remains below potential, meaning that current levels of economic activity continue to support the anticipated short-term disinflation path. Under the present monetary policy stance, demand-side inflationary pressures are expected to stay contained.
Inflation Dynamics: Easing Headline and Core Rates
The Committee reported that annual headline inflation fell to 12% in August 2025, down from 13.9% in July, while annual core inflation declined to 10.7% from 11.6%.
This moderation, according to the MPC, reflects subdued monthly inflation developments in August — 0.4% for headline inflation and 0.1% for core inflation — largely driven by declining food prices and relative stability in non-food components.
The MPC highlighted that the broad-based easing in monthly inflation over the past three months signals improving inflation expectations and the gradual unwinding of previous supply shocks.
In light of these developments, CBE estimates indicate that inflation will continue to decelerate, averaging between 12% and 13% in the third quarter (Q3) of the current year, compared with 15.2% in the previous quarter.
Over the medium term, inflation is projected to continue its downward trend, albeit at a slower pace, shaped by gradual declines in non-food inflation and the impact of ongoing fiscal consolidation measures.
Policy Outlook: Sustaining the Disinflation Path
According to the MPC’s projections, average headline inflation is expected to hover around 14% in 2025, approaching the CBE’s target range by Q4 2026.
“Given the progress achieved in disinflation and the improved inflation outlook, the Committee judged that cutting the CBE’s key policy rates by 100 basis points was appropriate to anchor expectations and support the anticipated disinflation path,” the statement said.
The MPC reaffirmed its data-dependent approach, emphasising that the pace of future monetary easing will be assessed on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Decisions will continue to depend on the evolving inflation outlook, risk balance, and incoming data.
It added that the CBE remains fully committed to achieving price stability, and “will not hesitate to use all available monetary tools” to guide inflation toward its targets of 7% (±2%) in Q4 2026 and 5% (±2%) in Q4 2028, on average.
The MPC’s latest rate cut reflects confidence in Egypt’s ongoing disinflation trend amid improving inflation expectations, stronger growth momentum, and continued stability in global prices. However, the CBE cautioned that risks remain tilted to the upside, particularly from potential regulated price adjustments and heightened geopolitical tensions, underscoring the need for vigilance as it calibrates the path of monetary easing.",711,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8450037837028503,2025-12-08T21:30:03.153894

The milestone supports the Ministry’s strategy to boost production, expand exports, enhance value added and strengthen national industries.
The shipment, valued at $2m, departed from Adabiya Port and included 20,000 tonnes of calcined petroleum coke produced from 27,000 tonnes of green petroleum coke.
The export marks the beginning of a new operational phase for the factory—located within the Ain Sokhna economic zone—following the completion of comprehensive rehabilitation and maintenance works across its production units.
Minister of Public Enterprises Sector Mohamed El-Shimy said the factory’s return to production and export reflects the state’s success in revitalising national industries and enhancing their competitiveness. He noted that the Ministry is pursuing an overarching vision to maximise the productive capacity of its affiliated companies, improve operational efficiency, increase industrial exports and deepen local content.
El-Shimy described the facility’s restart as a strategic move that restores a vital supply chain to Egyptian industry, particularly the aluminium sector, while contributing to higher exports and increased foreign currency revenues. He praised the factory’s workforce and reaffirmed the Ministry’s commitment to improving working conditions to ensure high performance and sustainable operations.
He added that reviving EgyptAnode forms part of the Ministry’s broader reform programme aimed at enabling its subsidiaries to operate as strong, competitive and sustainable industrial entities with greater contributions to the national economy.
Current operational data shows the factory is running at full capacity on its first production line, with an annual output of 130,000 tonnes. Production is expected to double to 260,000 tonnes per year in the first quarter of 2026 with the launch of the second line, raising projected annual revenues to around $25m.
In January 2025, EgyptAnode signed a five-year cooperation agreement with BP to implement rehabilitation works, enhance production and achieve the highest levels of operational efficiency—supporting the factory’s long-term competitiveness.
EgyptAnode is one of the first companies in the Middle East specialising in the calcination of green petroleum coke. It plays a key role in supplying essential raw materials to the aluminium industry and related heavy industries, relying on modern technologies and strict quality and safety standards that reinforce its position as a core pillar of national manufacturing.",401,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.92715322971344,2025-12-08T21:30:13.624763

He noted that the ministry now holds 3.5 billion electronic invoices and receipts that it aims to analyse more deeply to support the economy and improve service quality.
Kouchouk stressed that the government intends to work closely with all stakeholders to make effective use of the vast volume of data generated through automation and digital transformation. This “information wealth,” he said, represents a major opportunity for investment in AI.
Speaking at the “Future of the Accounting and Auditing Profession in Egypt in the Age of Artificial Intelligence” conference, organised by the Egyptian Society of Accountants and Auditors, the minister affirmed that artificial intelligence has the capacity to significantly boost productivity and revenues, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of public services.
He emphasised that the continuous development of the accounting and auditing profession is, in itself, a strong investment in Egypt’s broader economic competitiveness.
Kouchouk said the ministry will continue upgrading its systems to build more efficient, accessible and business-friendly tax services capable of supporting economic growth. He added that the government is closely attentive to recommendations made by accounting and auditing experts and is “highly open” to ambitious ideas, backed by incentives and institutional support.
The minister noted that the ministry aims to launch exceptional, long-term programmes for training and capacity building, in addition to expanding local and international partnerships to elevate the accounting and auditing profession.

2025-12-01,"UNCTAD warns of unprecedented economic collapse in Occupied Palestinian Territory, urges urgent reconstruction",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/01/unctad-warns-of-unprecedented-economic-collapse-in-occupied-palestinian-territory-urges-urgent-reconstruction/,"A new report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) warns that prolonged military operations and long-standing restrictions have driven the economy of the Occupied Palestinian Territory into its most severe contraction on record, erasing decades of development gains and deepening fiscal and social fragility.
The report, Developments in the Economy of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, finds that two years of military escalation and movement restrictions have triggered an unprecedented economic collapse across the Palestinian economy. This has unfolded against a backdrop of structural vulnerabilities, with far-reaching social, environmental and institutional consequences.
According to UNCTAD, extensive damage to infrastructure, productive assets and public services has reversed decades of socio-economic progress. The resulting crisis is now among the ten worst economic contractions recorded globally since 1960, while conditions in Gaza represent the most severe downturn on record.
At the same time, plummeting revenues and the withholding of fiscal transfers by the Israeli Government have severely constrained the Palestinian Government’s ability to maintain essential services or invest in recovery at a moment when large-scale spending is urgently required. The escalation has pushed the Palestinian economy from a prolonged slowdown into a near-total collapse, with repercussions across all sectors. In Gaza, the entire population has fallen into multidimensional poverty. The West Bank is experiencing its sharpest economic downturn on record, driven by heightened insecurity, increased movement restrictions and a collapse in productive activity.
By the end of 2024, Palestinian GDP had fallen back to its 2010 level, while GDP per capita returned to that of 2003—effectively wiping out 22 years of development gains in under two years.
Gaza: Economy reduced to a fraction of its former size
For nearly twenty years, 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza have lived under severe restrictions on trade, movement and access to resources within one of the world’s most densely populated areas. Limited entry of goods, restrictions on productive inputs and technology, and recurrent military operations have dismantled Gaza’s productive base, creating near-total dependence on external assistance.
In 2024 alone, Gaza’s GDP contracted by 83% compared with 2023, following a major decline the previous year. Over 2023–2024, GDP shrank cumulatively by 87% to $362m. GDP per capita fell to $161—among the lowest globally—and is now just 4.6% of the West Bank’s per capita income, down from near parity in 1994.
Destruction of infrastructure, widespread loss of productive capacity and mass displacement have caused lasting damage to human capital. Disruptions to education and basic services will have long-term consequences for livelihoods and societal resilience. Housing, utilities and essential infrastructure have been devastated, cutting off access to food, water, healthcare and public services, and creating an acute humanitarian and economic emergency.
UNCTAD warns that even with substantial international assistance, recovery to pre-October 2023 GDP levels could take decades. It stresses that ensuring the durability of the October 2025 ceasefire is essential to enable meaningful reconstruction, while humanitarian aid remains urgently needed.
West Bank: Sharpest downturn on record
Settlement expansion and movement restrictions continue to fragment the West Bank, constrain trade and investment, and reduce access to land, markets and resources for more than 3.3 million Palestinians. These constraints increase transport costs, lengthen travel times and disrupt access to employment, education and healthcare.
Since late 2023, movement restrictions have intensified further, sharply reducing economic activity. West Bank GDP contracted by 17%, while GDP per capita fell by 18.8%, returning to levels last seen in 2014 and 2008 respectively.
Fiscal pressures deepen institutional strain
The fiscal situation deteriorated markedly after October 2023, making 2024 one of the most challenging years for the Palestinian Government. Revenue shortfalls, the withholding of fiscal transfers, a contracting economy and declining external support have deepened the crisis, with pressures continuing into 2025.
Between January 2019 and April 2025, cumulative deductions and withheld fiscal transfers amounted to an estimated $1.76bn—equivalent to 12.8% of GDP in 2024 and 44% of total net revenues. Combined with a shrinking tax base and falling donor contributions, these shortfalls have severely limited the Government’s capacity to pay salaries, sustain essential functions and deliver basic services.
UNCTAD stresses that urgent and sustained international financial support is needed to stabilise public finances, safeguard institutional capacity and enable effective reconstruction.
Rebuilding Gaza requires more than $70bn
UNCTAD estimates the cost of reconstruction and recovery in Gaza at more than $70bn, underscoring the scale of investment needed to rebuild infrastructure, restore services and revive livelihoods.
The report calls for immediate and coordinated international intervention to halt the economic collapse, address the deepening humanitarian crisis and lay the foundations for sustainable peace and development. It urges a comprehensive recovery plan for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, coupled with restored fiscal transfers and measures to ease constraints on movement, trade and investment.
UNCTAD’s role
For nearly four decades, UNCTAD has provided policy research, technical cooperation and capacity-building support to the Palestinian people. Its work focuses on trade facilitation, productive capacity and institutional development, in partnership with public and private stakeholders and civil society, while also promoting international consensus on the needs of the Palestinian economy.",837,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9672011137008668,2025-12-08T21:30:21.681620

The framework, titled the “Real Estate Regulatory Unit,” aims to create a permanent system to oversee the sector, protect the rights of buyers and investors, and curb market manipulation and unregulated practices. Qoura said the plan would help stabilise the property market, improve project execution, eliminate “illusory property sales,” and position real estate as a driver of sustainable economic growth.
He stressed that the proposal’s core objective is to safeguard investors’ funds, protect buyers’ rights, and establish a fair legal structure that also supports developers and promotes overall market stability. Qoura added that, despite the sector’s strategic economic importance, particularly for Egyptians at home and abroad, as well as Arab and Gulf investors, Egypt still lacks a comprehensive law governing real estate transactions.
Under the proposal, a national real estate authority would be established to regulate the market and supervise projects. Each project would be required to operate a mandatory escrow account into which all customer payments and financing would be deposited. Disbursement to developers would be tied to verified construction progress, monitored by a general consultant and the proposed authority, to ensure timely and compliant project delivery.
The system, Qoura noted, is designed to benefit both buyers and developers. Buyers’ funds would be protected, while developers would be shielded from risks arising from unforeseen economic shocks such as currency devaluation. Compensation would be limited to actual cost differences without additional profit margins, helping ensure projects are completed even under challenging conditions.
The proposal also calls for unifying sales contracts across real estate companies, requiring standardised and transparent data on unit areas, pricing, services and facilities. This measure aims to reduce price disparities and curb unfair practices across the sector.
Drawing on international models tailored to Egypt’s market, the draft incorporates elements from the regulatory experiences of the UAE, Saudi Arabia and the United States, adapted to local circumstances.
Key features include the creation of a national coordinating body composed of representatives from the Ministries of Housing, Justice and Finance, as well as the Central Bank of Egypt, to oversee projects and regulate relationships between developers, buyers and financiers.
The plan also proposes launching a unified digital monitoring platform providing a comprehensive database of all projects, developers, actual prices and construction progress. Linked to banks, financing institutions and the New Urban Communities Authority, the platform would enhance transparency and enable real-time oversight.
To speed up dispute resolution, the proposal recommends establishing a specialised judicial unit comprising judges, legal advisers and engineering experts to handle real estate disputes efficiently, avoiding delays associated with traditional civil courts.
Additional measures include requiring developers to issue a digital unit identification certificate detailing the approved area, true price per square metre, project registration number and the project’s dedicated bank account. The draft also bans vague or misleading terminology in sales contracts.
The proposal seeks to attract foreign investment through tax and administrative incentives for environmentally compliant developers, simplified registration procedures for foreign buyers and strengthened international marketing of Egyptian real estate through embassies and diplomatic missions.
Post-delivery management is also addressed through provisions for dedicated maintenance accounts, with maintenance deposits transferred to homeowners’ associations to ensure service sustainability.
The proposal will now be examined by the relevant Senate committees before being referred to the House of Representatives and subsequently to the government for further consideration.",632,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.8861126899719238,2025-12-08T21:30:24.544949
2025-12-06,Netanyahu’s pick for Mossad chief sparks resignation threats over lack of experience,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/06/netanyahus-pick-for-mossad-chief-sparks-resignation-threats-over-lack-of-experience/,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to appoint his Military Secretary, Major General Roman Gofman, as the new head of the Mossad foreign intelligence agency has sparked a political storm and threats of mass resignations among agency officials, Israeli media reported.
Channel 13 cited current and former Mossad officials describing Gofman as a “veteran warrior” who nonetheless lacks essential experience in the world of intelligence.
“This is a severe blow to the organisation. Gofman’s appointment could put an end to the golden age of the institution,” a senior Mossad official told the channel.
Critics also pointed to a “problematic” issue in Gofman’s biography involving the employment of a teenager in an influence campaign, which reportedly resulted in the youth’s prolonged detention.
A senior security official previously described the appointment process as “delusional”, alleging that the Prime Minister’s wife, Sara Netanyahu, was unofficially involved. The official claimed she interviewed Gofman for the Military Secretary role before the proposal was submitted to the Senior Appointments Advisory Committee.
While reports suggest Netanyahu bypassed Mossad candidates he previously supported to appoint Gofman, raising concerns over his lack of intelligence background, his allies argued that his “loyalty, wisdom, and aggressive thinking suit the position”.
The Prime Minister’s office defended the choice, highlighting Gofman’s service in various operational and command roles within the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), including in the Armored Corps and as commander of the Etzion Brigade.
“Major General Roman Gofman is a multi-talented officer. His appointment as Military Secretary to the Prime Minister at the height of the War of Resurrection proved that he possesses exceptional professional capabilities,” the statement from Netanyahu’s office said, adding that Gofman maintained continuous contact with all intelligence agencies, particularly Mossad, during his tenure.
Gofman, 49, was born in Belarus and immigrated to Israel in 1990. He holds a bachelor’s degree in political science from Ashkelon Academic College and a master’s degree in political science and national security from the University of Haifa.
The appointment comes as Netanyahu’s government faces widespread internal criticism regarding the intelligence failure to predict the October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian factions on southern Israeli towns.",356,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.6197185516357422,2025-12-08T21:30:27.414148

Speaking at a weekly press conference following a cabinet meeting at the New Administrative Capital, Madbouly confirmed that the IMF mission arrived two days ago to commence the fifth and sixth reviews of the country’s loan programme. The delegation has already held initial meetings with the Minister of Finance and the Central Bank Governor.
“There is optimism that matters will proceed within a good framework in light of the positive indicators of the Egyptian economy,” Madbouly said.
He added that the country’s economic performance is tracking in line with government hopes, noting that “indeed some economic indicators have achieved better than what was targeted with the Fund.”
In a move to further stimulate the economy, Madbouly announced that President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi has approved the launch of a second package of tax facilities.
Madbouly explained that this is the second of four planned tax packages designed to improve the investment climate and support the private sector’s expansion. The first tranche was implemented last year, with the current package planned for execution this year.
Regarding structural reforms, the Prime Minister said the government is currently updating the “State Ownership Policy Document,” as the original three-year timeframe for the policy expires this December. He expects the final draft of the updated version to be ready by March, after which it will be presented for social dialogue.",256,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9120429158210754,2025-12-08T21:30:32.618664

The agreement aims to support the development of innovative green financial products and strengthen the bank’s institutional capabilities in sustainable finance.
The signing ceremony was attended by Tamer Negm, HDB’s Assistant Managing Director for Corporate Credit, Syndicated Loans, Treasury and Investment; representatives from the Frankfurt School and GIZ; as well as senior bank officials.
Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to advancing green finance solutions and institutional capacity-building in support of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Egypt’s transition toward a green economy, in line with global trends and domestic market priorities.
The partnership aligns with HDB’s strategic direction to expand innovative financing tools that embed sustainability principles across the banking sector. It also leverages the Frankfurt School’s extensive international experience in designing and implementing sustainable finance frameworks in emerging markets.
The cooperation will enable the development of a wide range of products, including green loans, sustainability-linked financing, and frameworks for green bonds and sustainable sukuk. It will also support the creation of green investment portfolios, introduce tailored financing mechanisms for SMEs operating in the green economy, develop tools to measure the environmental impact of financial products, and roll out awareness programmes to promote sustainable finance principles among clients.
Commenting on the agreement, Tamer Negm expressed his pride in the strategic partnership and praised the Frankfurt School’s global leadership in sustainable finance. He said the MoU represents a significant milestone in HDB’s expansion of sustainable financial offerings and underscores the bank’s commitment to adopting international best practices to deliver innovative products that meet the needs of the Egyptian market amid accelerating environmental and economic transitions.
Negm highlighted that Q3 2025 marked strong momentum in the bank’s sustainable finance efforts, with HDB’s sustainable finance portfolio rising to EGP 6.93bn,  a 70% increase compared to 2024. Sustainable financing now accounts for 23% of the bank’s total corporate, syndicated loan, and SME financing portfolio, up from 13% during the same period last year, reflecting clear progress in embedding sustainability across the bank’s operations.
He added that the partnership represents a major step toward institutionalising sustainability across HDB’s activities, enhancing internal capabilities, and fostering innovative financial tools that support Egypt’s national drive towards a green economy. Negm affirmed that sustainability remains a core pillar of the bank’s identity and a fundamental component of its 2025–2030 strategy.",432,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8653440475463867,2025-12-08T21:30:35.522623
2025-12-07,GAFI launches guideline for cash investment Incentive to support industrial projects,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/gafi-launches-guideline-for-cash-investment-incentive-to-support-industrial-projects/,"Hossam Heiba, CEO of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI), announced the release of the official guideline for the new cash investment incentive dedicated to industrial projects. The initiative reflects the government’s commitment to transparency, clarity, streamlined procedures, and accessible information for investors.
Heiba confirmed that the guideline is now available to all investors and can be accessed via the email link:
[email protected]
. He added that the committee responsible for administering the incentive has begun receiving applications through the same channel.
According to Heiba, the incentive represents one of the most significant mechanisms for attracting foreign direct investment, as it provides eligible investors with a direct cash payment disbursed after taxes are paid. The value of the incentive is linked to the volume of foreign financing allocated to the project, which must account for at least 50% of the project’s total capital. In addition, eligible projects must ensure that industrial products listed in the schedule attached to the Cabinet decision represent no less than 50% of their annual turnover.
GAFI previously issued Decision No. 675 of 2025 establishing the committee tasked with granting the cash investment incentive for industrial projects. The committee is chaired by a GAFI representative and includes members from the Industrial Development Authority, the Industrial Modernisation Centre, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Central Bank of Egypt, and the Egyptian Tax Authority.
The committee’s responsibilities include assessing applications, issuing decisions, granting eligibility certificates, providing annual approvals for incentive disbursement, and issuing preliminary approvals in accordance with Cabinet Decision No. 77 of 2023.
Heiba noted that, consistent with the state’s strategy to support the industrial sector, localize manufacturing, and enhance the competitiveness of Egyptian products as a driver of economic growth, Law No. 160 of 2023 was enacted to amend certain provisions of the Investment Law. The amendment added Article 11 (bis), which provides industrial investment projects with a cash incentive without affecting other incentives already granted by the law. Cabinet Decision No. 77 of 2023 further defined the requirements, controls, and criteria for implementing the incentive—from eligibility conditions and classifications to disbursement and oversight mechanisms.
The decision also allows industrial projects to obtain a preliminary approval valid for three years, giving investors added assurance that they will receive the incentive even if regulatory changes occur during the implementation period.",390,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.8345538973808289,2025-12-08T21:30:38.351023

The event is attended by governors of Arab central banks and representatives from regional and international financial institutions.
“I am honoured to participate in the current session… which serves as an annual platform for regional dialogue and cooperation on economic and monetary trends,” Abdalla said in a statement. He noted that this year’s session comes at a critical time, in light of the challenges confronting the global economy, particularly those arising from trade wars, which demand “precise and timely responses from central banks.”
Abdalla underscored that “encouraging increased domestic production and strengthening productive capacities are two core pillars in containing inflationary pressures and achieving long-term economic stability.” He affirmed the commitment of central banks to advancing their tools in line with the evolving global economic landscape, ensuring price stability while supporting economic resilience.
The ongoing session, chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank of Sudan, addresses several key topics, including the challenges central banks face in managing shocks from trade wars, frameworks to strengthen cybersecurity, and the progress of the Comprehensive Instant Digital Payments Initiative in Arab Countries.
The session will also review the outcomes of technical committees specialising in banking supervision, financial inclusion, green financing, and financial stability. A closed session is scheduled to discuss preparations for the third round of mutual evaluations and the challenges facing the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.

He highlighted that tax revenues increased by EGP 600bn during the last fiscal year without imposing any additional burdens, thanks to a confidence-based partnership framework with the business community.
Speaking at an open dialogue with students at Nile University, Kouchouk noted that the 73% jump in private investment reflects tangible economic improvement. “No one risks their money out of courtesy,” he said, describing this as a strong step toward restoring private-sector confidence and incentivising its role as the engine of economic growth.
The minister stressed that the government’s primary focus is to increase state resources to enhance citizens’ quality of life. “We need to grow revenues to improve spending on healthcare, education, and social protection,” he said.
Kouchouk also explained that Egypt’s economic and fiscal policies prioritise supporting production and exports across all sectors, including human capital. He emphasised that Egypt remains open to global investors, offering increasingly diverse and competitive economic opportunities. “The economy is in good shape, and what is coming is even better with rising private investment,” he noted.
To simplify compliance, the ministry plans to provide tax services via a dedicated mobile application and is seeking partnerships with leading artificial intelligence firms to maximise data use and improve taxpayer services.
The minister underscored the government’s readiness to support entrepreneurial ventures, pointing out that the simplified tax system offers numerous incentives for start-ups and SMEs. He also highlighted growth in the ICT sector and the state’s aim to expand digital and service exports.
Kouchouk further highlighted efforts to reduce public debt and strengthen fiscal indicators. He said Egypt successfully cut budget-sector debt by 10% over two years, while external debt fell by around $4bn. “The government remains committed to fiscal discipline while stimulating economic activity through performance-linked incentives,” he added.
Addressing the students, Kouchouk concluded: “Public service and serving your country is both an honour and a responsibility. Youth must take part in everything we do. They are the future. Never stop dreaming, work to achieve your ambitions, and we are right behind you.”",361,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9462611675262452,2025-12-08T21:30:55.089686
2025-10-19,CBE attributes inflation slowdown to easing food prices for fourth consecutive month,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/19/cbe-attributes-inflation-slowdown-to-easing-food-prices-for-fourth-consecutive-month/,"Egypt’s annual urban headline inflation declined to 11.7% in September 2025, down from 12% in August, marking the fourth consecutive month of moderation, according to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). This deceleration was primarily driven by a sharp slowdown in annual food inflation, which dropped to 1.4% in September—its lowest level since April 2021.
While food inflation eased significantly, non-food inflation remained relatively stable. It has hovered around 20.8% since the beginning of the year and recorded 19.1% in September. However, annual core inflation—which excludes volatile items such as food and energy—accelerated to 11.3% in September from 10.7% in August. This uptick was largely attributed to rising services inflation, most notably a 12% increase in rents. Monthly core inflation reached 1.5%, compared to 1.0% in the same month last year.
Monthly urban headline inflation recorded a rate of 1.8% in September 2025, slightly below the 2.1% registered in September 2024. This monthly increase was mainly driven by higher prices for fresh fruits and vegetables as well as services.
In rural areas, headline inflation also eased, falling to 8.9% in September from 10.3% in August. On a national level, annual headline inflation declined to 10.3%, compared to 11.2% the previous month.
Despite the annual slowdown in food inflation, monthly food inflation rose to 2% in September. This increase contributed 0.7% to the monthly headline inflation rate. The rise was mainly due to increases in prices of volatile food items, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. Fresh fruit prices increased by 5.6%, while fresh vegetables rose by 15.5%. Egg prices also increased by 5.7%, contributing further to the monthly rate.
Services prices climbed by 3.2% in September, contributing 0.89% to monthly headline inflation. The notable rise in rents accounted for 0.74% of this figure, alongside increased spending in restaurants and cafés.
Retail item prices rose by 0.8% during the month, contributing 0.11%. This was mainly due to higher prices of household appliances, cleaning supplies, and personal care products, in addition to seasonal increases in clothing, stationery, and school supplies associated with the start of the academic year.
Regulated prices saw a smaller increase of 0.3%, contributing 0.07% to monthly inflation. This was driven by a 0.8% rise in tobacco prices and a 1.1% increase in the price of LPG butane gas cylinders.
Monthly core inflation reflected the cumulative impact of these developments, recording 1.5% in September. The main driver was the services category, which contributed 1.2%, followed by retail items and core food, contributing 0.2% and 0.1% respectively.",416,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.7981115579605103,2025-12-08T21:31:05.302906

The increase was largely driven by higher fuel prices, following the government’s decision to raise petroleum product prices by 10.5–12.9% in October.
The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) reported that monthly core consumer price index (CPI) climbed to 2% in October 2025, compared with 1.5% in September 2025 and 1.3% in October 2024. On an annual basis, core inflation reached 12.1%, up from 11.3% the previous month.
Meanwhile, the nationwide annual inflation rate eased slightly to 10.1% in October, compared to 10.3% in September, CAPMAS said.
The CPI for the entire country reached 264.3 points in October, marking a 1.3% monthly increase. CAPMAS attributed the rise to higher costs in several key categories, particularly food, clothing, housing, and utilities.
Notable price gains were recorded in grains and bread, meat and poultry, dairy products, oils and fats, vegetables, sugar and confectionery, beverages, and tobacco. Prices of textiles, ready-made clothing, footwear, rent, and household maintenance also moved higher.
In contrast, fish and seafood prices declined by 0.3%, fruits fell by 10.6%, and audio-visual equipment, computers, and hotel services registered minor decreases.
Looking ahead, the CBE projects average annual headline inflation to ease to 14% in 2025 and 10.5% in 2026, down from 28.3% in 2024, before converging toward its medium-term target of 7% (±2%) by Q4 2026 and 5% (±2%) by Q4 2028.
At its October meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut key interest rates by one percentage point, bringing the deposit rate to 21%, the lending rate to 22%, and the main operation and discount rates to 21.5%.
The committee said the move supports the decline in inflation expectations and reinforces monetary policy consistency, while warning that inflation remains subject to upside risks, including potential administrative price adjustments and geopolitical tensions in the region.",321,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.6626359820365906,2025-12-08T21:31:26.725285

Speaking during a meeting with an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission in Cairo, Al-Mashat reported that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth reached 5.3% in the first quarter of the year, a figure she described as exceeding expectations.
The talks were held as part of the fifth and sixth reviews of Egypt’s economic reform programme.
Al-Mashat attributed the first-quarter performance to improvements in industrial production, citing increased growth rates in sectors such as vehicles, textiles, and ready-made garments. She stated this indicates a shift toward high-productivity, tradable sectors.
To maintain macroeconomic stability, the minister highlighted the government’s adherence to a public investment ceiling of EGP 1trn last fiscal year. She noted that limiting public spending had “opened the way for more private-sector investments”.
On structural reforms, Al-Mashat pointed to the establishment of a State-Owned Enterprises Unit. The unit has been granted a mandate to maximise asset value and determine the most appropriate scenarios for state-owned companies, in line with the State Ownership Policy Document aimed at empowering the private sector.
The minister also presented “Egypt’s Narrative for Economic Development,” a framework designed to transform the economic model to focus more on production and exports. She added that the ministry’s “Quarterly GDP Note” now includes data on structural reforms to improve transparency.
Regarding climate policy, Al-Mashat told the mission that two new projects had been added to the “NWFE” country platform to support the transition to renewable energy. She also outlined efforts to integrate environmental dimensions into public investment criteria to address climate risks to assets.
The ministry is currently implementing the “Adaa” system to monitor national and sectoral policies, aiming to link allocated appropriations to specific results and ensure public spending efficiency, Al-Mashat said.",316,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7812051177024841,2025-12-08T21:31:29.595883

The initiative aligns with the World Bank Group’s goal, set in April 2024, of providing essential health services to 1.5 billion people globally by 2030.
Under the compact, Egypt has outlined a five-year reform plan focusing on strengthening primary healthcare, enhancing financial protection, and supporting job-rich economic growth. Key measures include modernising healthcare facilities, expanding digital health tools, training medical professionals, and increasing insurance coverage, all aimed at improving accessibility and affordability for citizens.
The launch comes amid regional challenges such as aging populations, rising chronic diseases, and increasing financial pressures on households. Globally, 4.6 billion people lack access to essential health services, while 2.1 billion face financial hardship due to medical costs, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable health system reforms.
Egypt’s National Health Compact includes several priority initiatives. The country is expanding digitally connected health facilities to improve service delivery, strengthening the healthcare workforce through advanced training and digital tools, and reducing financial barriers by widening health insurance coverage and providing targeted support for vulnerable populations. The plan also seeks to enhance local production of health technologies and pharmaceuticals through investment in training and the establishment of specialised Centres of Excellence.
The World Bank Group, Gavi, the Global Fund, and philanthropic partners are supporting Egypt and other compact countries with aligned financing, technical assistance, and capacity-building to ensure effective implementation of reforms.
Egypt’s participation in the National Health Compact reflects the government’s commitment to building a more resilient and equitable health system, while generating economic opportunities through healthcare expansion.",279,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7007718682289124,2025-12-08T21:31:34.812762
2025-12-07,"Amazon Egypt expands storage capacity amid rising demand, local manufacturing boom",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/amazon-egypt-expands-storage-capacity-amid-rising-demand-local-manufacturing-boom/,"Egypt has endured one of the most challenging economic periods in its recent history over the past two years. Surging inflation and sharp exchange-rate volatility have reshaped consumer behaviour, pushing households to prioritise essential goods over discretionary spending. According to Omar Elsahy, General Manager of Amazon Egypt, this shift has been clearly reflected in purchasing trends on Amazon.eg.
“Demand for essential goods, particularly food items and basic household products, has grown tremendously,” Elsahy told Daily News Egypt. “Our priority was to strengthen our presence in these categories to ensure that Egyptian families could access the essentials they rely on every day.”
At the same time, he noted, an unexpected trend has taken hold: a significant rise in the availability and quality of locally manufactured products. Egyptian factories and artisans have increased production across sectors such as apparel, home goods and personal accessories, offering high-quality items at more accessible prices.
“The rise of local manufacturing has been transformative for Egyptian e-commerce,” Elsahy said. “Customers are increasingly choosing local products not just for price, but for quality and uniqueness. Supporting these entrepreneurs is part of Amazon’s DNA, hence our dedicated storefronts and programmes for Egyptian SMEs. When local sellers succeed, customers get better selection, communities flourish, and the digital economy grows stronger. Despite economic challenges, this vibrant seller community has contributed significantly to e-commerce growth over the past three years.”
Elsahy revealed that Amazon’s storage footprint in Egypt has now expanded to more than 100,000 cubic metres. “This includes our main fulfilment centres in 10th of Ramadan and on the Suez Road, supported by several additional operational sites run through local partners.”
One of the newest facilities, he added, offers storage capacity equivalent to ten football fields, underlining Amazon’s long-term investment in Egypt’s digital infrastructure. “These expansions are not a temporary reaction to rising demand. They are part of a forward-looking strategy to prepare for the next three years of growth.”
Much of this strategy is rooted in Egypt’s progress in financial inclusion, logistics development and its advancing digital economy, all critical to enabling faster, more reliable e-commerce operations.
Since Amazon launched in Egypt in 2021, collaboration with government authorities has intensified. Elsahy described it as a “shared vision” aimed at strengthening the digital economy and empowering local manufacturers and sellers.
He noted that the Prime Minister’s meeting with Amazon’s global CEO in April served as a progress review to ensure that expansion plans align with the government’s digital-transformation and financial-inclusion agenda. “Government support has been crucial,” he said. “It facilitated licensing, enhanced the regulatory environment and enabled smoother business operations.”
Amazon has also broadened cooperation with chambers of commerce and SME-support programmes, integrating hundreds of factories and companies into its seller network. As a result, more Egyptian products are reaching wider audiences on Amazon.eg.
Financial solutions have become an increasingly important part of Amazon’s customer offering in Egypt. The company has expanded payment options through strategic partnerships with financial-service providers including Valu and several banks.
“Egyptian customers are looking for flexibility in how they pay, particularly for higher-value purchases,” Elsahy explained. “Our collaborations allow customers to spread payments over time, making more products accessible to more people.” These partnerships have introduced innovative tools, especially during major sale events such as the White Friday Sale—including 0% interest instalments, buy-now-pay-later options and exclusive discounts for specific bank cards.
“Every investment decision we make centres on customer needs,” he emphasised. “We continuously evaluate these collaborations to ensure they help customers get what they need, when they need it, at prices they can afford. That is the lens through which we view all our business decisions.”
Addressing speculation about robots, drones and other futuristic technologies, Elsahy clarified that most of Amazon’s innovation happens behind the scenes. Visible tools—such as warehouse robots or drone delivery—are not what ultimately define service quality. “What truly elevates the customer experience is faster fulfilment, higher accuracy and better availability.”
Despite economic volatility, Elsahy remains optimistic. “Egypt has tremendous potential, with strong customer demand across many categories. We grow thoughtfully, but never before we are ready to deliver a great customer experience.” His closing message reflects Amazon’s global philosophy: “Every decision begins with one question, does it serve the customer? If the answer is yes, we move. If not, we wait.”",710,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.912598192691803,2025-12-08T21:31:37.684762
2025-10-14,Egypt’s Al-Mashat expects 2026 to be ‘turning point’ for economy after Gaza deal,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/14/egypts-al-mashat-expects-2026-to-be-turning-point-for-economy-after-gaza-deal/,"Egypt’s Minister of Planning and International Cooperation said she expects 2026 to be a “turning point” for the country’s economy, with a peace deal in Gaza set to restore normal navigation in the Suez Canal and boost revenues alongside growth in industry and tourism.
Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg after the Sharm El-Sheikh peace summit, Minister of Planning Rania Al-Mashat said a sustainable settlement would be “very positive” for both Egypt and the cost of global trade.
“It is a very important day, not just for the region but for the entire world,” Al-Mashat said of the summit. “We know that the Palestinian people have suffered for two years, so reaching a resolution and laying the foundations for peace will be essential for the future of the region.”
Al-Mashat also said that President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi had a “decisive and clear vision” for achieving peace in Gaza from the beginning of the conflict, based on a full commitment to the rights of the Palestinian people.
She highlighted that Egypt had dealt flexibly with the decrease in Suez Canal traffic caused by regional tensions by implementing necessary economic reforms since March 2024. These reforms, including fiscal consolidation, a flexible exchange rate, and a ceiling on public investments, contributed to GDP growth reaching 4.4% by the end of June and 5% in the last quarter, she said.
“If we look at the structure of growth in Egypt, we find that its sources come from increased manufacturing activity, benefiting from the reforms implemented in March 2024,” Al-Mashat said, adding that the country is continuing an ambitious structural reform programme to increase competitiveness and foster private sector participation.
She pointed to recent strong investment flows, especially in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, as favourable opportunities for the Egyptian economy to increase production and exports.
Al-Mashat added that during the upcoming annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, Egypt will present its economic reform story and highlight the continuation of positive momentum following the historic summit.
She also noted that a recent credit rating upgrade by Standard & Poor’s is proof that the reforms are moving in the right direction. “We are committed to them, and we are working to open the economy further, increase competition, and overcome the challenges we faced during the past years,” she said.",389,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9381394982337952,2025-12-08T21:31:48.102859

Nationwide inflation also decelerated, falling to 11.2% from 13.1% over the same period.
The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) reported that monthly core inflation—which excludes volatile items such as food and energy—rose by just 0.1% in August, down from 0.9% in August 2024 and recovering from a negative 0.3% in July 2025. On an annual basis, core inflation dropped to 10.7% in August from 11.6% the previous month.
The CBE forecasts that headline inflation will average between 14 and 15% for the full year, in line with its decline to 15.2% in the second quarter of 2025, down from 16.5% in the first quarter.
In light of the easing inflationary trend, the CBE’s Monetary Policy Committee decided on 28 August to cut key interest rates by 200 basis points. The overnight deposit rate now stands at 22%, the overnight lending rate at 23%, and both the credit and discount rate and the main operation rate at 22.5%.
According to the committee, the decision reflects its assessment of recent inflation developments and projections since its last meeting on 10 July. The CBE stated that demand-side inflationary pressures are expected to remain limited, supported by tight monetary policy and consistent with the short-term downward trend in inflation.
The bank reiterated its commitment to returning inflation to its target range of 7% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2026, and further to 5% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2028. However, it warned that inflation remains subject to upside risks, including changes in administratively set prices and rising geopolitical tensions in the region.
The CBE noted that the interest rate cut is consistent with maintaining a policy stance that anchors expectations and supports the anticipated disinflation path. It emphasized that the pace of monetary easing will be determined on a meeting-by-meeting basis, based on updated forecasts, economic data, and associated risks. The bank added that it will continue to closely monitor economic and financial conditions and use all available tools to ensure price stability and guide inflation toward its medium-term targets.",365,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9423425197601318,2025-12-08T21:31:59.571455
2025-12-07,Egypt launches initiative to transform petroleum waste into value-added resources,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/egypt-launches-initiative-to-transform-petroleum-waste-into-value-added-resources/,"Egypt’s Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy, Mahmoud Esmat, and Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Karim Badawi, witnessed on Sunday the signing of a cooperation protocol aimed at transforming petroleum-sector waste into value-added resources. The signing took place at the Electricity Ministry’s headquarters in the New Capital.
The agreement forms part of a broader state strategy to strengthen coordination between key authorities and ensure the efficient management of natural resources in a way that maximises economic returns.
The protocol, signed between the Nuclear Materials Authority and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), covers the treatment of technically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material (TE-NORM) generated by petroleum activities. It aims to ensure safe handling, treatment, and disposal in line with national and international environmental and health standards.
The agreement was signed by Hamed Meira, Chair of the Nuclear Materials Authority, on behalf of the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy, and Salah El-Din Abdelkarim, EGPC CEO, representing the Ministry of Petroleum.
Under the protocol, the Nuclear Materials Authority will be responsible for the treatment of petroleum waste including sediments, produced water, sludge, and other by-products—whether currently accumulated at sector sites or generated in the future. The Authority will conduct surveys and environmental assessments, prepare safe disposal and treatment plans, apply best-available technologies, and issue regular progress reports.
EGPC, meanwhile, will identify waste sites, types, and quantities, prepare technical reports, provide samples for analysis, and offer technical and logistical support to facilitate field surveys and assessments.
The cooperation supports the two ministries’ joint work plan to maximise returns from raw materials and extract valuable elements, especially rare minerals.
Esmat highlighted ongoing efforts to enhance the value of Egypt’s natural resources and the presidential directives to accelerate their optimal utilisation. He underscored the importance of providing the necessary technical capabilities and adhering to licensing, monitoring, and safety standards, alongside establishing joint technical committees to oversee implementation.
For his part, Badawi described the protocol as a strong model of integration between the petroleum and electricity sectors. He stressed that the petroleum sector’s expanding activities must go hand-in-hand with environmental protection, consistent with the ministry’s strategy that prioritises safety, emissions reduction, and sustainable resource management.
He added that proper waste treatment and recycling help transform waste into economic opportunities while advancing the environmental sustainability of petroleum and mining operations.",385,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.619785726070404,2025-12-08T21:32:04.839255

Hossam Heiba, CEO of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI), made the comments during the main session of the Egypt-Gulf Trade and Investment Forum in Cairo.
“The government aims for Egypt to be a regional centre in specific sectors where it has a high competitive advantage, primarily energy, tourism, and industry,” Heiba said. “GAFI has prepared its promotional plan to contribute to achieving these goals, and we have succeeded in attracting Arab and foreign investments in these sectors.”
Heiba reviewed the legislative and procedural amendments launched by the government to improve the investment environment since the 2017 investment law. He noted that GAFI has moved to the electronic establishment of companies and the digitalisation of services provided to investors.
“The successful Arab investor in Egypt is the most important element of promotion for the Egyptian economy, so the expansions of current investors receive the same incentives granted to new investments,” he added.

After months of slowing inflation and signs of macroeconomic stability, there is now a near-consensus among experts and investment banks that the CBE will reduce its key policy rates by between 1% and 2%.

Global context
Looking ahead
The upcoming decision comes at a critical juncture for Egypt’s economy. Policymakers are seeking to sustain the progress achieved in curbing inflation while simultaneously laying the groundwork for stronger private sector activity, investment inflows, and growth momentum. The debate now centres not on whether rates will be cut, but by how much — and how rapidly the easing cycle will unfold in the months ahead.
At its last meeting on 10 July, the MPC opted to keep its key rates unchanged: 24% for overnight deposits, 25% for overnight lending, and 24.5% for both the credit and discount rate and the main operation rate. That pause followed two successive rate cuts earlier in the year: a 225-basis-point reduction on 17 April and a further 100 basis points on 22 May.
In its July communiqué, the Committee explained that maintaining rates was “preferable” in order to allow time to assess the effects of new fiscal measures — including amendments to the value-added tax law and changes in administered prices — on inflationary dynamics. The MPC underscored that its decisions would continue to be data-dependent and conditional on the inflation outlook, potential risks, and external developments.
Inflation picture: A steady decline
Latest figures suggest that inflationary pressures have been easing consistently since the start of the year.
Core inflation
, as measured by the CBE, stood at 11.6% in July, up slightly from 11.4% in June but still well below last year’s peaks. On a monthly basis, core consumer prices actually declined by 0.3% in July, compared to a 0.2% decline in June.
Urban headline inflation
, published by CAPMAS, fell to 13.9% in July from 14.9% in June. The monthly urban CPI contracted by 0.5% in July after a 0.1% drop in June — further evidence that disinflationary forces are gaining strength.
The CBE projects that annual headline inflation will remain broadly stable at current levels for the rest of 2025 before resuming a gradual decline in 2026, converging towards the medium-term target of 7% (±2%) on average in Q4 2026. Much of this trajectory hinges on the impact of non-food price adjustments, global commodity trends, and fiscal consolidation measures.
Mohamed Abdel Aal
Expert views: Divided between 1% and 2% cuts
Banking veteran Mohamed Abdel Aal expects the MPC to opt for a 200-basis-point cut, resuming the easing cycle after July’s pause.
“Both headline and core inflation have now stabilised — at 13.9% and 11.6% respectively — largely due to lower food and beverage prices, which offset pressures from non-food inflation linked to administered price adjustments,” he said.
According to Abdel Aal, external disinflationary forces are reinforcing the trend. “Global declines in raw materials and imported goods prices are cushioning the domestic impact of subsidy rationalisation and higher VAT. This will likely allow inflation to continue falling through year-end.”
He argued that the CBE now has space to reduce rates without jeopardising stability:
Macroeconomic indicators remain broadly stable.
Global geopolitical tensions have eased somewhat.
Real interest rates have widened to levels that risk stifling private sector recovery.
“By year-end, I expect a total of 400 basis points in cumulative cuts, bringing the key rate closer to 20%,” Abdel Aal said. “A 200-basis-point cut would send the right signal.”
Still, he cautioned that the MPC could decide to remain conservative, particularly if it wishes to gauge the effects of customs duties or renewed regional instability.
Furthermore, HC Securities’ research team also forecasts a 2% cut, pointing to improved external indicators.
Macroeconomic analyst Heba Mounir highlighted several stabilising factors:
The Egyptian pound has appreciated around 5% year-to-date.
Egypt’s one-year credit default swap (CDS) spread has narrowed, signalling reduced sovereign risk.
Workers’ remittances have increased, bolstering FX inflows.
Net international reserves have expanded, providing a stronger buffer.
The banking system’s net foreign asset position has improved.
In parallel, Egypt’s domestic debt market continues to attract foreign participation. The latest 12-month Treasury bill auction cleared at 26.08%, equivalent to a positive real yield of 6.66% (after tax, based on HC’s inflation estimate).
“Despite expectations of rising energy costs, the MPC has room to cut rates by 200 basis points,” Mounir argued. “Slowing inflation, stronger external accounts, and the appreciation of the pound all strengthen the case.”
In contrast, banking analyst Shaimaa Wagih believes the MPC will prefer a more measured approach — a 100-basis-point cut.
“The CBE must strike a delicate balance: supporting growth while ensuring financial stability,” she said. “Inflation has slowed, but risks remain from Egypt’s foreign currency financing needs and potential capital outflows if yields fall too quickly.”
She noted that:
A gradual 1% cut would help ease borrowing costs for businesses and households without creating undue pressure on the pound.
Cheaper credit would boost investment, lending, and liquidity in the stock market.
The government would benefit from lower debt servicing costs, freeing fiscal space for social and developmental spending.
However, she cautioned that overly aggressive cuts could deter foreign investors in Treasury bills and bonds. “Capital flows need close monitoring,” she stressed. “A cautious pace avoids the risk of inflationary rebound.”
For Wagih, the most “professional” scenario is therefore a modest 100-basis-point cut that signals commitment to easing without triggering instability.

Market surveys: Consensus on cuts
Two major international surveys reinforce expectations of a rate reduction:
A
Reuters poll
of economists found consensus around a 100-basis-point cut at Thursday’s meeting, aimed at supporting growth amid declining inflation.
A
Bloomberg survey
of eight investment banks reached a similar conclusion, with most forecasting at least a 100-basis-point cut. Only two institutions anticipated rates remaining unchanged.
Among the banks participating in the surveys were EFG Holding, Naeem, Zeila Capital, CI Capital, Ahli Pharos, Prime, Mubasher Financial Services, Thndr, Cairo Capital, and Arabia Online.

Implications for the economy
1. Private sector revival
Lower interest rates would reduce financing costs for businesses, encouraging investment and expansion. This is particularly important for Egypt’s manufacturing and SME sectors, which have been squeezed by years of tight monetary conditions.
2. Banking sector dynamics
While banks could face narrower margins on interest spreads, this may be offset by stronger lending volumes. Retail credit — from mortgages to consumer loans — is likely to benefit, while corporate borrowing could regain momentum.
3. Capital markets boost
The stock market could see renewed liquidity as investors rebalance portfolios away from short-term debt instruments. Historically, rate cuts have been accompanied by rallies in equities, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and banking.
4. Fiscal relief
Lower rates would ease the government’s debt servicing burden. With debt costs consuming a significant portion of expenditure, even a modest reduction could free resources for public investment, infrastructure, and social protection.
5. Risks to manage
The main risks lie in external financing and the pound’s stability. A sudden outflow of foreign portfolio investment or a spike in energy import costs could put pressure on the exchange rate. This explains why some analysts favour gradualism over aggressive cuts.
Global context
Egypt’s anticipated move comes amid a broader shift in emerging markets, where central banks are cautiously unwinding the steep hikes of the past two years. Brazil, Chile, and Hungary have all entered easing cycles, while Turkey and South Africa are expected to follow suit in late 2025.
At the same time, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have signalled that their tightening cycles are over, with markets pricing in potential rate cuts in early 2026. This global backdrop provides the CBE with some room to manoeuvre, as capital flows into emerging markets remain supportive.
Looking ahead
MPC decision will likely set the tone for monetary policy in the final quarter of 2025. If the CBE opts for a bolder 200-basis-point cut, it could signal an acceleration of the easing cycle. A more cautious 100-basis-point move, however, would suggest gradualism and careful calibration.
Either way, analysts agree that the trajectory is downward, with policy rates expected to decline by at least 300–400 basis points by year-end — provided inflation remains on its current disinflationary path.
The balancing act for Egypt’s policymakers is clear: continue to anchor inflation expectations while providing breathing space for the private sector and supporting growth. The choice between a 1% or 2% cut may be tactical — but the direction of travel is unmistakable.",1494,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.8442087173461914,2025-12-08T21:32:15.464469

These include a high-tech medical equipment financing product with flexible repayment plans suited to the operational dynamics of healthcare institutions, as well as dedicated financing programmes enabling doctors and pharmacists to establish or expand specialised clinics and medical centres. The bank will also introduce green financing bundles to support energy-efficiency initiatives and sustainable operations within healthcare facilities.
Kashmiry made her remarks during her participation in the second annual Healthcare Investment Summit, attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health and Population Khaled Abdel Ghaffar; Minister of Finance Ahmed Kouchouk; and Ghada Tawfik, Assistant Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt for Corporate Social Responsibility.
The summit addressed a wide range of themes, including government efforts to stimulate investment in healthcare services; emerging opportunities for investors amid economic recovery and state-led incentives; and the localisation of medical industries supported by exchange-rate stability. Discussions also covered mechanisms for enhancing healthcare capacity to meet rising demand while managing cost and pricing pressures, as well as pathways for strengthened cooperation among the public, private and banking sectors to elevate service quality nationwide. The event further examined the growing role of banks and financial institutions in delivering products that support the expansion and accessibility of healthcare services and drive investment in this high-potential sector.
Kashmiry emphasised that healthcare and medical services financing sits at the core of United Bank’s strategy to support sustainable economic and social development. This includes financing hospital expansions, specialised medical centres, diagnostic laboratories and pharmacies, through tailored solutions for SMEs and retail financing programmes designed Specifically for doctors and pharmacists. She also highlighted the bank’s support for medical technology companies, a segment that has seen significant growth over the past three years amid rising demand for expansion, modernisation and digital transformation across the sector.
She explained that United Bank’s healthcare financing strategy is built around three pillars: supporting the expansion and development of hospitals and medical centres—particularly in governorates with limited specialised services; advancing digital health transformation; and empowering medical professionals and healthcare entrepreneurs through customised SME financing programmes covering medical equipment, laboratories and pharmaceutical services.

2025-11-01,CBE projects inflation to average 10.5% in 2026 as economic recovery gains momentum,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/01/cbe-projects-inflation-to-average-10-5-in-2026-as-economic-recovery-gains-momentum/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has projected a continued decline in inflation over the next two years, with annual headline inflation expected to average 14.0% in 2025 and 10.5% in 2026, compared to 28.3% in 2024. The Bank anticipates inflation will gradually converge towards its target of 7% (±2%) on average by the fourth quarter of 2026, signalling steady progress toward price stability following two years of inflationary pressures.
In its Q3 2025 Monetary Policy Report, the CBE emphasised that while the disinflation trend remains broadly intact, it continues to face upside risks from both domestic and global fronts. These include a higher-than-expected passthrough from fiscal consolidation measures, global commodity price volatility, and potential geopolitical flare-ups that could disrupt trade and energy markets.
Monetary Policy Report: Anchoring Transparency and Expectations
The CBE’s latest report underscores its ongoing efforts to enhance monetary policy transparency and strengthen public confidence in its inflation-targeting framework. It presents a detailed analysis of global and domestic developments, shedding light on inflation dynamics, growth trends, and financial conditions shaping the Egyptian economy in the third quarter of 2025.
The report also provides an outlook section offering a forward-looking assessment of headline inflation and real economic activity. This analysis is supported by an evaluation of the prevailing balance of risks, ensuring a data-driven approach to policymaking and market guidance.
Additionally, the report includes three thematic boxes highlighting critical aspects of monetary policy conduct:
The Basic Institutional Design of an Inflation Targeting Regime, exploring the structural underpinnings of Egypt’s transition toward a full-fledged framework.
Headline vs. Core Inflation, analysing the interplay between the two indicators and their implications for policy calibration.
Economic Activity and Employment: Does Okun’s Law Hold for Egypt?, which examines the empirical relationship between output and employment in the Egyptian context.
Economic Outlook: Growth Gathers Pace
Real GDP growth is expected to strengthen in the coming fiscal years, with projections of 4.8% in FY 2025/26 and 5.1% in FY 2026/27, according to the CBE. This acceleration will be driven primarily by robust performance in key sectors such as manufacturing, extractions, and services, alongside progress in monetary easing that is expected to bolster real private-sector credit growth.
The forecast also factors in a gradual recovery in Suez Canal revenues, underpinned by the expected normalisation of maritime activity in the Red Sea following the recent Gaza armistice. The CBE projects that the output gap will continue to narrow over the forecast horizon, with overall output levels approaching their potential by the end of FY 2025/26 — an indicator of a healthier, more balanced economy.
Global Developments: Moderating Inflation and Renewed Capital Flows
Globally, economic growth continued to recover in the second quarter of 2025 and is anticipated to maintain its momentum in the third quarter, albeit at a slower pace. This expansion is largely driven by emerging market economies, while developed markets exhibit moderate growth amid cautious monetary easing.
Global inflation has been moderating steadily, approaching central banks’ target ranges as commodity prices—particularly energy and food—have continued to ease. Energy prices stabilised, while international food prices declined for the fourth consecutive month through September 2025.
Improving inflation dynamics prompted central banks in both advanced and emerging economies to cautiously advance their monetary easing cycles, leading to more accommodative global financial conditions. This shift has resulted in a notable increase in capital inflows to emerging markets, including Egypt, where investor sentiment has been further reinforced by improving macroeconomic fundamentals and progress on structural reforms.
Egypt’s Sovereign Rating Upgraded by S&P
In a significant vote of confidence, S&P Global Ratings upgraded Egypt’s long-term sovereign credit rating from ‘B-’ to ‘B’ in October 2025, reflecting enhanced confidence in the country’s economic outlook. The upgrade was supported by the continued implementation of reform measures, stronger real growth, and improving external sector indicators, including rising reserves and healthier balance-of-payments dynamics.
The agency also noted Egypt’s commitment to fiscal discipline and the CBE’s effective inflation management, which together contribute to a more sustainable macroeconomic trajectory. The rating upgrade is expected to further reduce Egypt’s borrowing costs in international markets and enhance its attractiveness to portfolio and direct investors.
Domestic Developments: Inflation Eases and Growth Broadens
Domestically, the inflation outlook has shown clear signs of improvement. Annual headline inflation decelerated to an average of 12.5% in Q3 2025, compared to 15.2% in Q2, driven largely by a pronounced decline in food inflation, which has now reverted to pre-2022 levels.
Core inflation also moderated to 11.2%, down from 11.6% in the previous quarter, reflecting lower cost pressures and an easing in supply chain disruptions. Nonetheless, non-food inflation remained relatively persistent, fuelled by higher service costs—particularly rents—and moderate adjustments in administered prices.
The CBE’s nowcast for Q3 2025 signals a continued recovery in economic activity, with quarterly growth expected to hover around 5%. Key growth drivers include non-petroleum manufacturing, tourism, and the Suez Canal, which have all shown robust post-crisis recoveries.
Real Sector Performance and Demand Dynamics
Egypt’s real GDP at market prices expanded by 5.0% in Q2 2025, marking the fastest growth since early 2022. This strong performance lifted FY 2024/25 growth to 4.4%, up sharply from 2.4% in the previous year.
The rebound was primarily fuelled by higher private consumption and gross domestic investment, particularly in construction, manufacturing, and technology-driven sectors. The CBE expects demand-side inflationary pressures to remain contained, supported by the prevailing monetary policy stance and the projected path of the output gap.
Labour Market Trends and Wage Developments
In the labour market, real wages recorded positive growth for the fourth consecutive quarter during Q2 2025. While this improvement reflects a gradual recovery in household purchasing power, wage levels remain below their 2022 averages, suggesting limited inflationary pressure from the wage channel. Employment growth was strongest in manufacturing, logistics, and tourism—sectors that have benefited most from renewed investment and demand recovery.
External Sector: Current Account Improves and Reserves Strengthen
The current account deficit narrowed by 41% year-on-year in Q2 2025, driven by sustained increases in workers’ remittances, tourism receipts, and transport revenues, particularly from the Suez Canal. However, this improvement was partly offset by a wider hydrocarbon trade deficit, due to higher natural gas imports to meet local consumption needs.
Meanwhile, the financial account surplus remained robust, underpinned by continued foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows sufficient to cover the current account deficit. Consequently, Egypt’s overall balance of payments registered only a marginal deficit of $0.2bn in Q2 2025—a marked improvement over previous quarters.
On the monetary front, M2 money supply growth continued to slow, averaging 22.6% in Q3 2025, compared to 24.2% in Q2, reflecting tighter liquidity management and declining inflation expectations.
Monetary and Financial Conditions
The CBE reported a substantial improvement in net foreign assets (NFAs) within the banking system, which increased by $3bn between June and August 2025 to reach $17.9bn. This gain was primarily driven by commercial banks’ improved foreign exchange positions, sustained remittance inflows, and renewed portfolio investments.
Private-sector credit also expanded strongly, with local currency loans growing by 14.5% in Q3 2025, up from 12.6% in the previous quarter. The expansion reflects stronger credit demand and improving business confidence, supported by the CBE’s gradual monetary easing cycle, which saw cumulative policy rate cuts of 625 basis points in 2025.
The Bank noted that approximately 97% of policy rate cuts were transmitted to the interbank market, where the overnight rate averaged 23.6% in Q3 2025, down from 27.5% in Q1, confirming effective policy transmission.
Financial Markets and Sovereign Yields
Egyptian Eurobond yields declined by an average of 66 basis points in Q3 2025, continuing their downward trajectory since the start of FY 2024/25. This reflects more accommodative global financial conditions, declining sovereign risk, and a more sustainable macroeconomic position.
Improved investor confidence, combined with the sovereign rating upgrade and stronger fundamentals, is expected to further ease external financing pressures and support capital inflows into Egypt’s debt and equity markets over the medium term.
Optimistic outlook
The CBE’s latest projections signal a cautiously optimistic outlook for Egypt’s economy. With inflation on a downward path, growth gaining momentum, and external accounts improving, macroeconomic stability appears to be gradually taking hold.
Nevertheless, the Bank emphasises that continued structural reforms, fiscal discipline, and geopolitical stability will be essential to sustain this progress and reinforce resilience against external shocks.
If current trends persist, 2026 could mark a turning point for Egypt—ushering in a new phase of stable growth, anchored inflation, and renewed investor confidence in the country’s long-term prospects.",1406,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.7168768644332886,2025-12-08T21:32:21.152146
2025-11-22,Inflation-related risks necessitate cautious monetary-easing approach: CBE,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/22/inflation-related-risks-necessitate-cautious-monetary-easing-approach-cbe/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has cautioned that persistent inflation-related risks necessitate a prudent approach to the ongoing monetary easing cycle.
During its meeting last Thursday, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the CBE’s key policy rates unchanged — maintaining the overnight deposit rate at 21%, the overnight lending rate at 22%, and both the main operation rate and the credit and discount rate at 21.5%. These rates represent the main benchmark for short-term interest movements on the Egyptian pound.
The decision was widely anticipated by economists and investment banks.
So far this year, the CBE has cut interest rates by a cumulative 6.25%, with reductions of 2.25% in April, 1% in May, 2% in August and 1% in October.
In its accompanying statement, the MPC said the decision reflects its assessment of the latest inflation data and expectations since its previous meeting.
Globally, the Committee noted that indicators point to a continued recovery in economic activity, although global forecasts remain clouded by uncertainty over trade policies and persistent geopolitical tensions. Against this backdrop, central banks in advanced and emerging economies have generally taken a cautious stance in easing monetary policy.
On commodity markets, it said oil prices have been broadly stable, while many agricultural commodity prices have retreated. Nonetheless, upside risks to inflation remain, particularly the possibility of renewed disruptions to global supply chains.
Domestically, the MPC said the CBE’s estimates point to a slight improvement in economic growth, with real GDP expanding by 5.2% in the third quarter (Q3) 2025 compared with 5.0% in Q2. This acceleration was supported by strong performance in non-oil manufacturing, trade and tourism. The Committee added that output is expected to continue approaching full capacity, which is anticipated to be reached by the end of fiscal year 2025/2026.
Unemployment rose marginally to 6.4% in Q3 2025, from 6.1% in the previous quarter.
Regarding inflation, the MPC reported that the annual headline inflation rate increased to 12.5% in October 2025 from 11.7% in September. Core inflation also rose, reaching 12.1% in October compared with 11.3% a month earlier. It added that monthly inflation deviated from its typical seasonal pattern due to higher non-food prices — particularly services — which offset the impact of slowing food inflation.
The Committee stressed that further moderation in monthly inflation dynamics is needed for headline inflation to converge toward the CBE’s target.
It added that inflation expectations remain exposed to both global and domestic upside risks, including any escalation in geopolitical tensions, the persistence of services inflation, and fiscal consolidation measures that may exceed earlier projections.
Given these risks, the MPC said it must closely monitor inflation developments and their implications for the outlook, underscoring the need for caution in the monetary easing cycle.
The Committee said it therefore opted for a wait-and-see approach by holding policy rates steady, viewing this stance as appropriate for containing inflationary pressures, anchoring expectations and returning inflation to its downward path.
It reiterated that it will continue to assess its policy decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis, guided by expectations, risk assessments and incoming data. The CBE added that it stands ready to deploy all available tools to achieve price stability and steer inflation toward its target of 7% (± 2%) on average in Q4 2026.",545,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8376665115356445,2025-12-08T21:32:24.060417

Speaking at a meeting with the American Chamber of Commerce on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings in Washington, D.C., Kouchouk said Egypt’s economy is growing steadily and encouragingly, supported by a strong, diverse, and dynamic private sector operating within a more competitive business environment.
He highlighted the government’s ongoing economic and fiscal reforms, along with tax and customs facilitation measures designed to attract further private investment.
“We are continuing along a path of trust and partnership with the business community through pragmatic and flexible approaches to tax challenges,” Kouchouk said. “Our commitment is to drive growth through a more inclusive and sustainable vision, centred on a healthy, private sector–led economy focused on manufacturing and exports.”
The minister noted that preliminary indicators for the first quarter of the current fiscal year point to balanced and stable financial performance, with a primary surplus exceeding EGP 170 billion, declining government debt, and strong growth in tax revenues — driven by an expanded tax base and improved relations with taxpayers.
Kouchouk emphasised that Egypt’s reform programme continues to progress positively, reflected in improved perceptions among investors, markets, and international rating agencies. He said Egypt has also shared details of its recent fiscal and structural reforms with the IMF, demonstrating the success of the previous fiscal year’s outcomes.
He revealed that Egypt’s privatisation and public offering programme will, for the first time, open new sectors to private and foreign investors — including airports, insurance, and telecommunications. The government is also assessing financial and non-financial incentives to encourage companies to list on the Egyptian Exchange (EGX) and increase trading volumes, he added, noting that the Egyptian market has the capacity to attract hundreds of new private firms with strong investment returns.
Addressing the role of technology, Kouchouk underscored the transformative impact of electronic tax systems in simplifying compliance and expanding the taxpayer base. “Automation has enabled us to build a more transparent, trustworthy, and predictable relationship with the tax community,” he said during a panel discussion on digital transformation in tax administration held as part of the IMF and World Bank meetings.
He added that digitising and streamlining procedures reduces the cost of voluntary compliance and attracts new taxpayers, while ensuring technological solutions are effectively employed to enhance services and protect taxpayer rights.
Kouchouk also highlighted the ministry’s efforts to develop skilled human capital capable of managing advanced digital systems, alongside establishing continuous communication channels with the tax community to explain ongoing reforms and their long-term benefits.",440,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9441251754760742,2025-12-08T21:32:28.004195

Speaking at the third annual conference of the Regional Network in Energy for Women in the Middle East and North Africa (RENEW MENA), Al-Mashat stated that the presence of women in energy is valuable precisely because the sector has historically been male-dominated.
“The country’s largest mine is currently managed by a woman, which reflects the reality we witness daily: women are capable, qualified, and effective in every sector,” Al-Mashat said.
The minister noted that massive electrical interconnection projects—linking Egypt with Jordan and Saudi Arabia—are not only enhancing energy security but creating employment, with a significant number of women included in the teams managing these operations.
Al-Mashat said the transition to renewable energy, such as wind and solar, is critical for producing efficient, low-cost power while opening new horizons for jobs requiring “green skills”.
To support this shift, Egypt has launched a “National Narrative for Economic Development” to integrate policies and enhance labour market flexibility. Al-Mashat added that a new labour law includes specific elements to address obstacles hindering women’s participation, ensuring their professional rights and regulating the work environment.
“Development cannot be achieved without skilled cadres,” Al-Mashat said. She emphasised the importance of gender-responsive public spending and financial tools, such as green bonds and sustainable development goal (SDG) bonds, to fund activities that elevate women’s presence in the economy.
Organised by the World Bank, the conference included participation from Stephane Guimbert, the bank’s Country Director for Egypt, Yemen, and Djibouti, and Anna Bjerde, World Bank Managing Director of Operations.
RENEW MENA, supported by the World Bank and the Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP), functions as a platform to accelerate gender equality in the energy sector, involving over 60 partners from public institutions, private companies, and academia.",325,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.6657184958457947,2025-12-10T09:27:27.263291

Speaking during a panel discussion in Saudi Arabia, El-Khatib stated that Egypt is currently working to raise the level of private sector involvement in energy production and associated industries to support economic growth and sustainable development.
The development of data centres and artificial intelligence represents a joint strategic direction for Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the minister said, noting that these sectors rely directly on energy as a primary component for operation and growth.
El-Khatib added that ongoing economic transformations in both nations provide a significant foundation for building wider investment partnerships. He said the two countries aim to present a globally competitive regional model through policies that attract capital and utilise renewable energy to build a low-carbon economy.
Strategies currently being implemented aim to achieve a sustainable, long-term balance in the energy sector, the minister said. He noted that recently announced deals reflect the seriousness of current trends and the region’s ability to attract additional capital.
El-Khatib concluded that Egypt’s structural reforms are designed to build industrial capabilities based on clean energy and AI, reinforcing the country’s position as a regional hub for energy, manufacturing, and logistics.
The panel, titled “Sustainable Investment Opportunity”, also included Saudi Investment Minister Khalid Al-Falih, Vision Invest Africa Advisory Board Chair Amadou Hott, EIG Partners MENA Chairperson Abdulaziz Al-Gudaimi, and ACWA Power CEO Marco Arcelli.",253,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8842384219169617,2025-12-10T09:28:30.044586

The meeting aligns with Egypt’s national strategy to scale up renewable energy within its power mix and advance the country’s broader energy transition agenda.
Esmat highlighted the government’s commitment to opening new avenues for British companies in clean energy, ranging from solar and wind power projects to grid-strengthening initiatives and the localization of key electrical components used in renewable systems.
He noted that Egypt aims to raise the share of renewable energy in its electricity mix to more than 42% by 2030 and 65% by 2040, in line with its long-term sustainable development and decarbonization plans. The Minister also underscored the role of modern technologies, knowledge exchange, and specialized training, emphasizing that the private sector remains an essential partner in advancing the country’s renewable energy portfolio.
Esmat further stressed the centrality of the electricity sector to Egypt’s industrial, agricultural, and urban development. He pointed to the country’s abundant solar and wind resources and reiterated the government’s efforts to foster an attractive investment environment, draw foreign capital, and work closely with international financial institutions to implement large-scale renewable projects.
Ambassador Bryson-Richardson praised the depth of expertise within Egypt’s electricity sector and affirmed the UK’s eagerness to enhance cooperation across various segments of the power industry. He also expressed his commitment to encouraging more British investors to explore opportunities in Egypt’s expanding renewable energy market.
The two sides agreed to maintain close coordination to support ongoing projects and broaden joint initiatives that contribute to cleaner energy, lower emissions, and sustainable economic growth.",292,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8840985298156738,2025-12-10T09:28:50.631326

During the meeting, Fountain Set outlined its plans to expand into the Egyptian market through the establishment of a new spinning and weaving complex. The proposed industrial facility will span 200,000 square metres and may operate under either the free zone regime or the special economic zone framework. The project is expected to attract investments of approximately $100m, generate around 1,500 direct jobs, and serve as a key hub for producing and exporting textiles to European and African markets.
The discussions also covered the expansion plans of Elegance Apparel Garments Freezone, which aims to increase its production capacity and broaden its operational footprint in Shebin El-Kom.
Heiba reaffirmed Egypt’s readiness to accommodate new investments, noting that the state has injected more than $4bn into modernising public-sector factories, including the acquisition of advanced European machinery. He emphasised that Egypt offers flexible partnership models for foreign investors—ranging from ownership to leasing and usufruct arrangements—allowing companies to select structures tailored to their needs.
He further highlighted the distinctions between Egypt’s various investment regimes, including public and private free zones as well as special economic zones such as the Suez Canal Economic Zone. This diversity, he said, enables investors to choose the framework best suited to their project while benefiting from a wide array of incentives and facilitations.
According to Heiba, Egypt’s strategic geographic position, extensive free trade agreements, and competitive labour market make it an attractive destination for export-oriented textile and garment industries. He also pointed to the strong industrial base in Mahalla El-Kobra, whose advanced textile capabilities offer opportunities for integration with new investments and for maximising the use of existing expertise and equipment.
Heiba stressed that the textile industry remains a national priority due to its critical role in boosting exports, deepening local manufacturing, and creating employment. This focus, he noted, reflects the state’s commitment to attracting major investments and expanding domestic production capacity.
Representatives of Fountain Set and Elegance Apparel expressed their appreciation for Egypt’s supportive investment climate and the facilitation measures extended to investors. They affirmed their eagerness to move forward with project implementation and to strengthen cooperation with Egyptian authorities to ensure swift progress on their expansion plans.",403,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7233666181564331,2025-12-10T09:29:07.137429

Silver has now gained 110% since the start of 2025, outperforming gold and most major industrial commodities. The gold-to-silver ratio has fallen to 69, its lowest level since July 2021, reflecting silver’s sharp outperformance.
The report noted that local gold prices rose by EGP 1 during Wednesday’s trading, with 800-carat gold increasing from EGP 74.5 to EGP 75.25 per gram. Silver prices strengthened in parallel, with 925 silver reaching EGP 87 per gram, 999 silver rising to EGP 94, and the silver pound coin steady at EGP 696.
Globally, silver climbed from $58.27 to $61 per ounce amid heavy buying and rising investor positioning in metals markets.
The report highlighted several factors underpinning silver’s rally, including expanding industrial demand in electronics, solar energy and semiconductor manufacturing. Ongoing global supply-chain disruptions since August have further tightened supply, while renewed investor interest in silver as a hedging asset continues to add support.
According to the Safe Haven Center, London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) inventories have increased by 1,447 tonnes since the beginning of the year, while COMEX stocks have risen by 4,311 tonnes. Global silver holdings remain heavily concentrated in London at a ratio of 1.91 to COMEX—the highest level since January.
ETF holdings now represent 78% of silver stored in LBMA vaults, up from 65% in November 2024.
Silver-backed exchange-traded funds recorded their strongest inflows since 2020, adding 487 tonnes in November and over 475 tonnes since early December, signalling robust institutional interest.
Standard Chartered Bank said silver still has room for additional gains but warned of short-term volatility as the market seeks a new equilibrium following the recent surge. Analysts expect a limited correction before prices attempt new highs, particularly amid uncertainty surrounding the Critical Minerals S232 report, which could further tighten regional supply.
International outlets, including Reuters, The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, report that silver is undergoing a “strategic transformation,” functioning both as a core industrial metal and a major investment asset. Forecasts suggest prices may trade within the $55-$70 range in the near term.
Despite its strong performance, analysts caution that silver prices could retreat if U.S. economic indicators strengthen or if major mining regions significantly increase production.",405,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7234614491462708,2025-12-11T09:28:34.394189
2025-12-10,Egypt’s urban inflation eases to 12.3% in November 2025,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/10/egypts-urban-inflation-eases-to-12-3-in-november-2025/,"Egypt’s urban inflation eased slightly in November 2025, dipping to 12.3% from 12.5% in October, according to data released on Wednesday by the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics (CAPMAS). Monthly inflation slowed markedly to 0.3%, compared with 1.8% in the previous month.
CAPMAS reported that the nationwide consumer price index reached 263.8 points in November, edging down by 0.2% from October.
The Agency attributed the decline chiefly to a 15.8% fall in vegetable prices, alongside a 0.2% drop in cereals and bread, a 1.5% decrease in meat and poultry, a 0.8% decline in fish and seafood, a 1.2% reduction in dairy products, cheese and eggs, and a 0.4% fall in personal belongings.
However, several categories saw price increases. Oils and fats rose by 0.3%, as did coffee, tea and cocoa. Mineral water, soft drinks and natural juices increased by 0.4%, tobacco by 0.3%, fabrics by 0.6%, ready-made clothing by 1.2% and clothing cleaning, repair and rental services by 1.4%.
Housing-related costs also climbed, including actual rent (up 2.1%), imputed rent (2.0%), maintenance and repair (0.9%), water and housing services (0.6%), and electricity, gas and other fuels (3.9%). Furniture, furnishings, carpets and floor coverings rose by 0.6%, household textiles by 1.3%, and glassware, tableware and household utensils by 0.9%.
Additional increases were recorded in home maintenance goods and services (1.4%), outpatient services (1.1%), hospital services (2%), vehicle purchases (2.1%), private transport expenditure (6.4%), transport services (8.3%), ready-made meals (1.3%), hotel services (1.6%) and personal care (1.4%).
Monthly core CPI inflation, computed by the Central Bank of Egypt, recorded 0.8% in November 2025, compared with 0.4% in November 2024 and 2.0% in October 2025. On an annual basis, core CPI inflation rose to 12.5% in November, up from 12.1% in October.
CAPMAS noted that the annual nationwide inflation rate stood at 10% in November, fractionally lower than 10.1% in October.
On 20 November, the Central Bank of Egypt’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) opted to keep key interest rates unchanged at 21% for deposits, 22% for lending and 21.5% for the credit and discount rate and the main operation rate, a decision widely anticipated by analysts and investment banks.
In its accompanying statement, the MPC said the decision reflected its assessment of recent inflation developments and the outlook since its previous meeting. It noted that further declines in monthly inflation were necessary to steer headline inflation towards the Bank’s target. It also reiterated expectations that annual headline inflation would rise towards the end of the fourth quarter due to higher energy prices before easing again in the second half of 2026, moving closer to target.
The Committee cautioned that inflation expectations remained exposed to upside risks both globally and domestically, including potential geopolitical escalations, persistently elevated service-price inflation and fiscal consolidation measures exceeding expectations.
It stressed that these risks required close monitoring and a cautious approach to the monetary easing cycle. Maintaining policy rates, it noted, supported efforts to contain inflationary pressures, anchor expectations and restore the downward inflation path.
The MPC confirmed that its decisions would continue to be made on a meeting-by-meeting basis and remain guided by the outlook, associated risks and incoming data. It added that it would not hesitate to use all available tools to achieve price stability and guide inflation towards its target of 7% (± 2%) on average in the fourth quarter of 2026.",559,daily_news_egypt,error,0.0,2025-12-11T09:29:33.089818

“We strongly oppose any alteration to the borders of Gaza and Israel,” UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said at a daily press briefing. He added that the comments run counter to both the spirit and the letter of the peace framework advanced by U.S. President Donald Trump, stressing that the UN recognizes only the established borders between Gaza and Israel.
The statement comes amid a deepening humanitarian crisis. Gaza’s Ministry of Health reported Wednesday that three people were killed and five wounded in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll since the war began in October 2023 to 70,369, with 171,069 injured.
Medical sources and eyewitnesses said a teenage boy from Jabalia refugee camp, Zahir Nasser Shamia, was fatally shot by Israeli forces and then run over by a tank near the so-called yellow line. According to sources who spoke with Anadolu Agency, Israeli troops had pushed into areas crowded with displaced families in Jabalia, firing heavily and blocking ambulances from reaching the critically wounded teenager. In a separate incident, a man and a woman were killed after being hit by Israeli military cranes near the Halawa camp for displaced people.
As military operations continue, winter conditions are compounding the already dire humanitarian situation. The Emergency Response Operations Room in Gaza urged international agencies to deliver shelter materials immediately, warning that heavy overnight rainfall had flooded dozens of tents and destroyed the belongings of displaced families. The group said the deteriorating conditions could lead to deaths among children and the elderly, given plunging temperatures and a severe shortage of basic protection. It described the provision of shelter as “a matter of saving lives” and called for urgent coordination to reach the hardest-hit areas.
Gaza’s municipality issued a parallel warning, citing the collapse of key infrastructure following months of bombardment. Municipal spokesperson Husni Mehanna said seven of the city’s eight main wastewater pumping stations have been destroyed, disabling roughly 90 percent of the system’s capacity. As a result, the city can process only about 20 percent of rainfall, raising the risk of widespread flooding in neighborhoods overcrowded with displaced civilians.
The UN has also highlighted the escalating threat posed by unexploded ordnance scattered across the strip. Julius van der Walt, head of the UN Mine Action Programme in the occupied Palestinian territories, said remnants of war are a major obstacle to restoring normal life, especially as hundreds of thousands of people begin moving around Gaza following the ceasefire. “Children are the most at risk,” he said, pointing to their curiosity and limited awareness of the dangers.
Regional leaders continue to press for steps toward a political solution. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said a “just and lasting peace” in Gaza requires strengthening the ceasefire and pursuing a two-state solution. He described the deaths of more than 70,000 Palestinians as a “grave violation” of the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
In Cairo, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty stressed in a call with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio the need to move to the second phase of the ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel. He urged implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2803, including the deployment of an international stabilization force in Gaza, the formation of a Palestinian technocratic committee to administer the strip, the safe delivery of humanitarian aid, and the reconstruction of critical infrastructure.
Meanwhile, Hamas condemned Israel’s approval of 764 new settlement units as “an expansionist measure” and a “serious escalation” that violates international law and UN Security Council resolutions. The group called on the international community to impose binding measures to halt settlement expansion.",638,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.8930813074111938,2025-12-11T09:30:27.267683
2025-12-13,Madbouly inspects Decent Life development projects in Qalyubeya,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/13/madbouly-inspects-decent-life-development-projects-in-qalyubeya/,"Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly conducted an inspection tour of several development projects implemented under the presidential Decent Life (Decent Life) initiative in villages of Shebin El-Qanater, Qalyubeya, as part of the government’s ongoing efforts to improve living standards and public services in rural areas.
The tour began with a visit to the Technological Center in Tahanoub village, where Madbouly reviewed the services provided to citizens.
Deputy Governor of Qalyubeya Eman Rayan explained that the center is one of the most significant development projects under the initiative and forms part of nine integrated service complexes established across Shebin El-Qanater. She noted that the facility operates as a one-stop hub for government and civil services, easing access for residents of Tahanoub and neighbouring villages and reducing the need to travel to urban centres.
Rayan added that the centre supports Egypt’s Vision 2030 digital transformation agenda by shifting from paper-based procedures to fully automated services. The facility includes a local administrative unit, food subsidy office, civil registry, real estate registry, modern post office and social affairs office. The project was completed at a cost of approximately EGP 9m, has reached full completion and is now fully operational.
Madbouly then inspected the Family Medicine Center in Tahanoub, implemented during the first phase of the Decent Life initiative.
He said health-sector projects under the initiative reflect the state’s commitment to delivering comprehensive and sustainable healthcare services, particularly in underserved areas.
Deputy Prime Minister for Human Development and Minister of Health and Population Khaled Abdel Ghaffar noted that Decent Life health projects are implemented through an integrated system that includes building and upgrading hospitals and health units, equipping medical facilities, and establishing specialised centres—an approach embodied by the Tahanoub Family Medicine Center.
Undersecretary of the Ministry of Health in Qalyubeya Osama El-Shalqani stated that the centre is one of 24 similar healthcare projects completed in Shebin El-Qanater villages. The three-storey facility provides a wide range of primary healthcare services, including family medicine, dental clinics, emergency care, pharmacy services, laboratories, radiology, maternal and child health services and administrative offices.
The centre was established at a cost of around EGP 60m, spans 850 sqm, includes 58 rooms and is staffed by 83 medical and administrative personnel. During the visit, Madbouly toured isolation rooms and clinics, reviewed service quality, checked medicine availability and assessed citizen turnout.
As part of the tour, the Prime Minister visited the Misr Public Library in Shebin El-Qanater, reaffirming the state’s support for cultural projects targeting youth and children. He stressed that public libraries play a vital role in spreading awareness, developing skills and supporting Egypt’s broader human development strategy.
Qalyubeya Governor Ayman Attia described the facility as a major cultural addition to the governorate, noting that it is the second Misr Public Library in Qalyubeya after Banha, with a third branch currently under construction in Shubra El-Kheima.
Ambassador Reda El-Taify, Director of the Misr Public Libraries Fund, said the Shebin El-Qanater branch is the 31st nationwide, within a network of 34 public libraries across 18 governorates, in addition to 24 mobile libraries.
The library consists of three floors and includes children’s and adults’ reading halls, a computer lab, activity and training rooms, a cultural theatre, creative learning spaces and a modern digital library. Madbouly interacted with children and students during the visit, encouraging them to read widely and deepen their knowledge of Egypt’s history and sciences.
The Prime Minister concluded his tour by inspecting the Veterinary Unit in Nowa village, another Decent Life project.
Undersecretary of the Veterinary Directorate in Qalyubeya, Hany Shams El-Din, explained that the unit is part of nine veterinary projects implemented in Shebin El-Qanater. The facility provides integrated veterinary services, including animal and poultry examinations, vaccinations, artificial insemination, ultrasound diagnostics, free medical convoys and a veterinary pharmacy.
Built on an area of 425 sqm, the unit serves four villages and surrounding areas and is fully operational. Madbouly also reviewed services offered by the adjacent agricultural complex, including farmer training programmes on modern cultivation techniques and safe pest-control methods.
The tour underscored the government’s continued commitment to implementing the Decent Life initiative as a comprehensive rural development model, aimed at upgrading infrastructure and expanding access to healthcare, education, culture and agricultural services across Egypt’s villages.",704,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.5574158430099487,2025-12-14T09:22:15.959410

2025-12-13,Egypt’s external debt reaches $161.2bn in June 2025: CBE,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/13/egypts-external-debt-reaches-161-2bn-in-june-2025-cbe/,"Egypt’s external debt rose to $161.2bn in June 2025, marking an increase of around $8.3bn, or 5.5%, compared with the end of June 2024, according to data released by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). The rise mainly reflected higher disbursements of external loans and credit facilities amounting to $5.4bn, in addition to valuation effects of about $2.9bn stemming from the depreciation of the US dollar against other currencies in which Egypt’s external debt is denominated.
Breakdown by Maturity
By original maturity, Egypt’s external debt structure continued to be dominated by long-term borrowing in June 2025. Long-term external debt stood at $130.3bn, while short-term debt by original maturity amounted to $30.9bn. Measured by residual maturity, short-term external debt reached approximately $54.6bn at the same date.
Breakdown by Type
The stock of long-term external debt increased by about $3.4bn year-on-year to reach $130.3bn in June 2025. This increase reflected mixed developments across debt instruments. Other bilateral debt rose to $18.6bn, up by $4.6bn, while repurchase agreements reached around $6.7bn. Bonds, notes and sukuk issued abroad and held by non-residents climbed to $28.7bn, representing an increase of about $1bn.
During FY 2024/2025, Egypt returned to international debt markets with two new issuances. The first was a $2bn Eurobond issued in US dollars, followed by a $1bn sukuk through a private placement with Kuwait Finance House. As of the end of June 2025, the outstanding stock of Egypt’s external bonds comprised approximately $20.3bn of US dollar-denominated Eurobonds, the equivalent of $3.5bn of euro-denominated Eurobonds, around $2.4bn of US dollar sukuk, the equivalent of $936.2m in Samurai bonds issued in Japanese yen, about $663.0m in US dollar green bonds, the equivalent of $488.5m in Panda bonds denominated in Chinese yuan, and roughly $345.5m in sovereign notes issued in US dollars.
Non-guaranteed private sector external debt increased by $0.7bn to reach $2.5bn, including $100m in green bonds and $499m in sustainability bonds. Meanwhile, rescheduled bilateral debt declined slightly by $0.2bn to $0.5bn. Long-term deposits, represented by Arab countries’ deposits at the CBE, remained unchanged at $9.3bn, comprising $5.3bn from Saudi Arabia and $4bn from Kuwait. Buyers’ and suppliers’ credit declined by $0.9bn to about $19.2bn, while debt owed to multilateral institutions fell by $4.1bn to reach approximately $44.8bn in June 2025.
Short-term external debt by original maturity rose by $4.9bn year-on-year to reach $30.9bn in June 2025. Deposits from Arab countries at the CBE accounted for around 35.9% of this stock, equivalent to $11.1bn.
Breakdown by Currency
An assessment of the currency composition of Egypt’s external debt shows that the US dollar remained the dominant borrowing currency in June 2025. US dollar-denominated debt amounted to $109.7bn, representing 68.0% of total external debt. The euro followed with $20bn, while other currencies collectively totalled $31.5bn. These included Special Drawing Rights valued at $15bn, the Chinese yuan at $5.9bn, the Kuwaiti dinar and the Japanese yen at $3.8bn each, and other currencies amounting to $3bn.
Breakdown by Creditor
By creditor type, Egypt’s external debt to multilateral institutions stood at $47.2bn in June 2025. The International Monetary Fund accounted for 30.1% of this total, equivalent to $14.2bn. This comprised $5.8bn under the Extended Fund Facility, $3.9bn related to Egypt’s IMF Special Drawing Rights allocation, $3.3bn under the New Extended Fund Facility, and $1.2bn under the Stand-By Arrangement.
Other major multilateral creditors included the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development with claims of $12.6bn, the European Investment Bank at $3.6bn, the African Development Bank at $2.6bn, and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development at $2.2bn.
In addition, Egypt owed $37.7bn to Arab countries, led by Saudi Arabia with $13.5bn, followed by the UAE with $11.7bn and Kuwait with $6bn. Furthermore, $18.8bn was owed to six Paris Club countries—Russia, the United States, Japan, France, Germany and the United Kingdom—while debt owed to China stood at $9.6bn.
Breakdown by Debtor Sector
By debtor sector, the Central Bank of Egypt’s external debt increased by about $2.7bn year-on-year to reach $37.3bn, accounting for 23.1% of total external debt, mainly due to a rise in long-term liabilities. External debt owed by other sectors rose by around $2.3bn to $19.7bn, reflecting higher short-term trade credits and long-term loans.
The government remained the largest obligor, with its external debt increasing by about $1.8bn to reach $82bn and accounting for roughly 50.8% of total external debt, largely as a result of increased bond issuance. Banks’ external debt rose by around $1.5bn to $22.2bn, representing 13.9% of the total, driven by higher short-term borrowing despite a decline in long-term debt.
External Debt Service
External debt service payments increased by $5.8bn to reach $38.7bn during FY 2024/2025, compared with FY 2023/2024. This increase was largely due to a rise of about $6.5bn in principal repayments, which totalled $30.2bn, while interest payments declined modestly by around $0.7bn to $8.5bn.
External Debt Indicators
Key external debt indicators showed that the ratio of external debt stock to GDP rose to 44.2% in June 2025, compared with 38.8% a year earlier. Short-term external debt by original maturity accounted for 19.2% of total external debt, up from 17.0% in June 2024, while its ratio to net international reserves increased to 63.5% from 56.1%.
Short-term external debt by residual maturity represented 33.8% of total external debt, slightly lower than the 34.5% recorded a year earlier, and its ratio to net international reserves declined to 112.0% from 113.8%. Meanwhile, the ratio of external debt stock to exports of goods and services improved to 223.0%, down from 243.4%. The annual debt service ratio rose to 53.6% from 52.4%, while the debt service ratio to current receipts declined to 34.5%, compared with 37.8% in June 2024.",939,daily_news_egypt,error,0.0,2025-12-14T09:22:45.314136

These include regulatory fragmentation, algorithmic bias, data-protection concerns and escalating cyber threats, all of which require robust digital infrastructure and adaptive legislative frameworks.
Abdalla made the remarks during the 20th High-Level Annual Meeting on Financial Stability and Supervisory Priorities, held in Abu Dhabi and organised by the Arab Monetary Fund in cooperation with the Financial Stability Institute and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at the Bank for International Settlements.
He underscored the importance of the issues discussed at the forum, noting that financial stability and evolving supervisory priorities have become a cornerstone of development ambitions across the Arab region. This comes at a time when the global economy is undergoing a complex transition marked by elevated inflation, volatile liquidity conditions and rapidly shifting geopolitical dynamics.
The CBE governor said these pressures are particularly pronounced in the Arab world due to high public-debt levels and persistent fluctuations in exchange rates and oil prices, factors that directly affect public finances, economic activity and investor confidence.
According to Abdalla, such challenges have compelled central banks to play a more expansive role in protecting monetary stability, reinforcing economic resilience and building more flexible financial systems capable of supporting growth, absorbing unexpected shocks and preserving market confidence.
He also highlighted the rapid expansion of non-bank financial institutions, whose share now accounts for nearly half of global financial assets. While these entities act as key drivers of market development and contribute to economic growth and financial inclusion, they also pose heightened risks that require more advanced, transparent and forward-looking regulatory frameworks.
Abdalla pointed to the accelerating pace of technological innovation, particularly the growing use of digital assets and stablecoins. He noted that their value has doubled over the past three years and that they now play an increasingly significant role in cross-border payments and transfers.
Turning to recent global banking stresses, Abdalla referenced the banking tensions witnessed in 2023 following the collapse of four banks. He said these events exposed the limitations of traditional liquidity standards in an environment characterised by rapid digital withdrawals and instantaneous fund transfers across online platforms. The failures, he explained, were driven by a combination of weak governance, inadequate risk management, unsustainable business models and insufficient supervisory oversight. These developments underscore the need for updated stress-testing frameworks, stronger operational preparedness and more proactive supervision capable of identifying vulnerabilities at an early stage.
Abdalla concluded by stressing that today’s financial stability challenges are inherently cross-border and cannot be effectively addressed by any single country acting alone. Enhanced cooperation and coordinated action are therefore essential to developing shared visions that strengthen the resilience of Arab financial systems and enable them to manage emerging risks while embracing innovation that supports sustainable development.",484,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.6743252873420715,2025-12-14T09:22:48.019179
2025-12-13,Egypt’s agricultural exports reach 8.8m tonnes to date: Agriculture Minister,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/13/egypts-agricultural-exports-reach-8-8m-tonnes-to-date-agriculture-minister/,"Alaa Farouk, Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, said total Egyptian agricultural exports have reached approximately 8.8 million tonnes so far this year, marking an increase of nearly 750,000 tonnes compared with the same period last year.
The figures were outlined in an official report submitted to the Minister by Mohamed El-Mounsi, Head of the Central Administration for Agricultural Quarantine at the Agricultural Services and Monitoring Sector, which detailed the latest developments and performance indicators for Egypt’s agricultural exports.
According to the report, citrus fruits continued to top the list of Egyptian agricultural exports, with total shipments exceeding 2 million tonnes. Fresh potatoes ranked second at around 1.3m tonnes, followed by sweet potatoes in third place with approximately 328,000 tonnes. Beans, both fresh and dry, came fourth with about 312,000 tonnes, while fresh onions ranked fifth with exports totalling roughly 282,000 tonnes.
The report also highlighted the strong export performance of several other crops, including grapes at around 191,000 tonnes, pomegranates at 154,000 tonnes, and mangoes at approximately 122,000 tonnes. Additional exports included tomatoes, fresh strawberries, fresh garlic and guava, reflecting the growing diversity of Egypt’s agricultural export basket.
In this context, Farouk said the record rise in agricultural exports provides clear evidence of the strength and resilience of the national economy. He added that the performance reflects Egypt’s commitment to meeting the highest international standards of quality and food safety, and represents global recognition of the country’s success in enhancing the competitiveness of its agricultural products.
The Minister noted that Egyptian agricultural products continue to enjoy strong confidence in international markets, reinforcing Egypt’s position as a leading global agricultural producer and exporter. He stressed that agricultural exports represent a key pillar of the national economy, contributing to foreign-currency inflows and supporting economic growth. Farouk also praised the collective efforts exerted across the entire value chain, from farmers and producers to exporters.
He further highlighted the pivotal role of the Central Administration for Agricultural Quarantine and the reference laboratories in ensuring the safety and quality of exported products, alongside the contribution of agricultural external relations. Farouk underscored the Ministry’s continued efforts, in coordination with relevant authorities, to open new and non-traditional markets, address logistical and procedural challenges facing exporters, and support the sustainability of growth in the agricultural export sector.",380,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9373766779899596,2025-12-14T09:23:09.286370
2025-12-13,saib Bank signs EGP 1.5bn mortgage-finance protocol with Social Housing Fund,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/13/saib-bank-signs-egp-1-5bn-mortgage-finance-protocol-with-social-housing-fund/,"saib Bank has signed a cooperation protocol with the Social Housing and Mortgage Finance Fund to strengthen collaboration in mortgage financing and provide funding for eligible applicants under the Fund’s housing programmes targeting low- and middle-income segments.
The protocol was signed by Afdal El-Sayed Naguib, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of saib Bank, and May Abdel Hamid, Chief Executive Officer of the Social Housing and Mortgage Finance Fund. The signing ceremony was attended by Tarek Abdo, Deputy Managing Director of saib Bank, alongside several senior bank executives. Representatives from the Fund included Hala Ghazy, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, and Omnia El-Maddawy, General Director of the Support Department.
Naguib said the bank’s participation in the Central Bank of Egypt’s mortgage-finance initiative for low- and middle-income households aligns with saib’s strategy to support the state’s development agenda and Egypt’s Vision 2030, which prioritises sustainable economic growth and extending support to the most vulnerable segments of society.
He added that mortgage financing remains a core priority for saib Bank, noting that the institution continuously assesses the needs of underserved groups and designs financing solutions tailored to their income levels and housing requirements. This approach, he said, is consistent with the CBE’s direction towards promoting social inclusion and economic sustainability.
Naguib stressed that the new protocol aims to help citizens secure residential units offered through the Fund’s various housing announcements, with the broader objective of providing safe, adequate and affordable homes for low-income families. He reaffirmed the bank’s commitment to offering flexible procedures and expanding access to mortgage finance, while strengthening its role within Egypt’s social-housing ecosystem.
For her part, Abdel Hamid said the Fund is keen to deepen cooperation with the banking sector to better serve applicants seeking affordable housing units. She highlighted saib Bank’s longstanding role as a key partner in providing mortgage financing to low- and middle-income citizens, noting that it was among the first private banks to collaborate with the Fund in this field.
She explained that the newly signed protocol renews a previous agreement between the two sides that was first concluded on 1 September 2020. Under the renewed arrangement, saib Bank will provide up to EGP 1.5bn in mortgage financing for eligible applicants, an expansion that further strengthens cooperation between the two institutions in support of the state’s affordable-housing initiatives.
Tarek Abdo, Deputy Managing Director of saib Bank, said the bank believes that every citizen has the right to adequate housing and is committed to simplifying financing procedures and offering practical banking solutions that meet the needs of low-income households, enabling them to acquire suitable homes under affordable terms.
He added that the partnership with the Social Housing and Mortgage Finance Fund reflects saib Bank’s broader commitment to supporting state-led initiatives that promote social justice and improve citizens’ quality of life. He noted that such projects not only address housing needs but also contribute to job creation and stimulate economic activity in sectors linked to real-estate development.
Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to deepening cooperation, emphasising that the new protocol builds on an established partnership and ensures continued access to mortgage financing for low- and middle-income citizens seeking housing through the Fund’s programmes.",526,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.789056658744812,2025-12-14T09:23:36.399670
2025-12-13,Opinion | Is now the right time to cut reserve requirements?,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/13/opinion-is-now-the-right-time-to-cut-reserve-requirements/,"The reserve requirement is one of the central monetary-policy instruments used by central banks to regulate liquidity and safeguard financial stability. In Egypt, it represents the share of bank deposits that the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) requires supervised commercial banks to hold as non-interest-bearing reserves. By setting this ratio, the CBE directly influences banks’ lending capacity and the overall resilience of the financial system.
Typically, the CBE raises the reserve requirement during periods of elevated inflation to absorb excess liquidity and contain price pressures. Conversely, when inflation moderates and moves closer to target, the ratio may be reduced to support credit growth and economic activity.
Any decision to lower the reserve requirement depends on several fundamental conditions, foremost among them a sustained decline in inflation and the stability of medium-term inflation expectations. Policymakers must be confident that core inflation is firmly under control and that expectations among households and businesses are well anchored around the target.
Central banks therefore tend to approach such a step with caution. A reduction from the current 18% level back to the previous 14%, for example, would release an additional 4% of banks’ total deposits for lending or investment. This would require strong assurance that the newly injected liquidity would not reignite inflationary pressures. At the same time, a lower reserve requirement would give banks greater flexibility in pricing loans and financial products, support profitability through expanded lending, and potentially allow part of the cost savings to translate into improved returns for depositors, thereby encouraging higher savings.
Despite these potential benefits, it may still be premature for the CBE to restore the reserve requirement to 14% or even to begin a gradual reduction at this stage.
Cutting the reserve requirement is a double-edged sword. Injecting a sizeable amount of liquidity into the system could have a stronger-than-intended impact on market conditions, complicating efforts to keep future inflation in check. This risk explains why central banks often prefer to rely on interest rates, which offer a more flexible and finely calibrated policy lever.
Any move in this direction would need to be carefully sequenced and could require a phased approach. Timing would be critical, and it may be more prudent to wait until inflation has stabilised at decisively lower levels before proceeding.
In my view, a reduction in the reserve requirement is more likely to be considered during the latter half of the monetary-easing cycle, once inflation is clearly converging towards target and macroeconomic conditions are more firmly anchored.
Ultimately, a cut in the reserve requirement would represent a meaningful policy shift, but one that demands precise timing and rigorous analysis. Acting too early risks doing more harm than good. For now, patience and a continued focus on broader economic stability appear to be the wiser course.

2025-12-13,"Winter storm compounds Gaza humanitarian crisis amid Israeli strikes, diplomatic efforts",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/13/winter-storm-compounds-gaza-humanitarian-crisis-amid-israeli-strikes-diplomatic-efforts/,"A winter storm that battered the Gaza Strip over the past few days has worsened an already dire humanitarian situation, killing additional people and exacerbating the impact of Israeli strikes, Palestinian officials said, as diplomatic efforts over the territory’s future gain momentum.
Ismail Al-Thawabta, director general of Gaza’s Government Media Office, described the three-day weather system as creating a “compound humanitarian disaster” on top of the devastation caused by Israeli military operations. Speaking at a news conference at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza on Saturday, he reported 11 deaths and one missing person after buildings previously damaged by bombardment collapsed under harsh weather conditions.
Al-Thawabta said government teams had documented the collapse of at least 13 homes, all hit earlier by Israeli strikes. More than 27,000 tents sheltering displaced people were swept away or flooded, while a total of over 53,000 tents suffered full or partial damage, leaving hundreds of thousands exposed to the elements.
Separately, Gaza’s Health Ministry reported that three Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire over the past 48 hours, with 16 wounded admitted to hospitals during the same period. Since a ceasefire took effect on October 10, the ministry said the death toll has reached 386, with 1,018 people injured.
On the military front, The Israeli occupation army’s radio reported an airstrike in Gaza City targeting what it described as Hamas’s second-in-command, Raed Saad, claiming he had been involved in rebuilding the group’s capabilities and weapons production. Hamas did not immediately comment.
US media have reported that Bulgarian diplomat Nikolay Mladenov is a potential candidate to represent a proposed “Peace Council” backed by the United States and endorsed by the UN Security Council to oversee Gaza in a future phase, following Arab objections to the nomination of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Neither nomination has been officially confirmed.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said any peace council must address what he described as the security problem posed by Israel. Speaking after a visit to Turkmenistan, Erdogan emphasised that Israel must honour its commitments and fully adhere to the ceasefire to allow life in Gaza to return to normal.
Humanitarian crisis
At the United Nations, Rick Peeperkorn, WHO representative in the occupied Palestinian territories, said approximately 1,092 patients in Gaza had died while awaiting medical evacuation between July 2024 and November 28, 2025. He warned that the figure is likely an underestimate. Peeperkorn added that 18 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals and 43% of primary healthcare centres were only partially functioning amid severe shortages of essential medicines and medical supplies. While some improvement has been seen in aid delivery approvals, the process of bringing medical equipment and drugs into Gaza remains “slow and unnecessarily complex.”
UNICEF warned of a severe health crisis, noting that malnourished pregnant women are giving birth to underweight and premature babies, many of whom are dying in neonatal intensive care or facing lifelong medical complications.
Two US officials said that US Central Command will host a conference in Doha on December 16 with partner nations to develop a plan for an international force to stabilise Gaza. More than 25 countries are expected to send representatives to discuss command structures and operational frameworks.
In New York, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution urging Israel to allow full humanitarian access to Gaza, stop obstructing UN agencies and comply with international law.

2025-12-14,Multiple pathways to deepen private-sector partnerships across key industries: El-Shimy,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/14/multiple-pathways-to-deepen-private-sector-partnerships-across-key-industries-el-shimy/,"Mohamed El-Shimy, Minister of the Public Enterprises Sector, presented the portfolio of companies affiliated with the ministry and reviewed their financial performance over the past decade during his participation in the Afro-Asian Investors Union Forum.
He said the forum represents a vital platform for strengthening historic ties and opening new horizons for investment cooperation and partnership between African and Asian countries. El-Shimy added that deeper investment integration between the two continents is a cornerstone for achieving sustainable development and accelerating economic growth amid ongoing global challenges.
The minister stressed that the Egyptian state places strong emphasis on expanding joint investment opportunities and building effective strategic partnerships based on mutual benefit. He explained that companies affiliated with the Ministry of Public Enterprises Sector constitute a key pillar of the national economy, encompassing eight holding companies operating in the metallurgical, chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, tourism, hotel and construction sectors. These holdings supervise 63 subsidiary companies, in addition to stakes in 106 joint-venture firms active across a wide range of productive and service industries.
El-Shimy noted that this framework aligns with Egypt Vision 2030, the Government Action Programme and the State Ownership Policy Document, ensuring coherence between public-sector reform and national development objectives.
He outlined the ministry’s ongoing comprehensive reform programmes aimed at improving corporate performance, modernising management systems, expanding private-sector participation, and keeping pace with technological advances. These efforts, he said, are being implemented in line with international standards for quality, sustainability, occupational safety and health, governance and human-capital development. The overarching objective is to maximise returns on state investments, enhance companies’ contribution to GDP, and strengthen their competitiveness at both local and international levels.
Mohamed El-Shimy, Minister of the Public Enterprises Sector
According to the minister, these reforms have already delivered tangible results, with a marked improvement in financial performance driven by restructuring, technical and administrative modernisation, more efficient asset utilisation and higher operational productivity.
El-Shimy highlighted a broad pipeline of investment and partnership opportunities with domestic and international private investors. In the metallurgical industries, projects include expanding the Nagaa Hammadi Aluminium Complex by 300,000 tonnes, establishing a new aluminium smelter with an annual capacity of 600,000 tonnes, developing an alumina refinery with a capacity of 2 million tonnes per year, and launching value-added projects such as car wheel rims and aluminium foil. Additional initiatives include a solar-glass production unit at El-Nasr Glass and Crystal Company and a seamless-pipe production line at El-Nasr Pipes Company.
In the chemical industries, opportunities cover the second phase of Delta Fertilizers’ development plan, involving upgrades and capacity expansion for ammonia and urea plants, a kaolin calcination project, and the development of Abu Zenima Port, operated by Sinai Manganese Company.
The pharmaceuticals and medical supplies sector features projects to localise the production of biological products at Nile Pharmaceuticals, including insulin and biosimilar alternatives, alongside a dry-powder inhalation line at the Arab Company for Pharmaceuticals, hormone-manufacturing localisation at CID Pharma, and local production of active pharmaceutical ingredients at El-Nasr Pharmaceutical Chemicals Company.
In the textile sector, which is undergoing a nationwide modernisation programme across seven governorates, investment opportunities include establishing an integrated denim-fabric industrial complex at Damietta Textiles Company and a knitted-garment manufacturing facility at Dakahlia Textiles Company.
The tourism and hospitality sector also offers multiple prospects, including the development of a tourist resort in Marsa Alam, the rehabilitation of the historic Continental Hotel in downtown Cairo, the Dahab Camp project, the conversion of the Misr Tourism Tower into a mixed administrative-hotel facility, and the utilisation of several high-value commercial assets in hospitality activities.
El-Shimy also reviewed urban-development opportunities within the construction and housing portfolio. These include developing the green zone and recreational services in New Heliopolis City, operated by Heliopolis Housing and Development Company, as well as integrated residential, administrative and commercial projects by El-Nasr Housing and Development Company in Mokattam, Joseph Tito Avenue and along the Maadi Corniche. Additional projects encompass land reclamation, cultivation and livestock production initiatives in Toshka.
The minister reaffirmed the ministry’s commitment to providing all necessary facilitation and support to investors interested in these projects, describing private-sector partnership as a strategic pathway to achieving sustainable economic development and strengthening regional economic integration.",690,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7508752346038818,2025-12-15T09:34:42.180064

Gamal El-Din welcomed Jasan Group’s entry into the Qantara West Industrial Zone, describing the project as a high-quality addition to Egypt’s textile and garment industry. He highlighted that the company’s fully integrated production model provides strong competitive advantages in terms of efficiency, quality and production capacity.
He added that Jasan Group’s decision to locate in Qantara West reflects the zone’s operational readiness, advanced infrastructure, competitive costs and strategic location near Mediterranean and Red Sea ports, enhancing access to international markets.
Gamal El-Din also noted that the number of projects in the Qantara West Industrial Zone has now reached 48, covering a total area of 3.26m square metres, with combined investments estimated at $1.325bn. These projects are expected to create around 69,665 direct jobs.
He stressed that SCZONE continues to intensify efforts to attract further foreign investments into the textiles and garments sector, supporting Egypt’s strategy to expand industrial exports and advance sustainable economic growth.
Jasan Group is among the world’s leading manufacturers of seamless garments, operating a fully integrated production system that includes spinning, dyeing, knitting, embroidery, printing and packaging, alongside a specialised research and development centre.

The inaugural session brought together heads of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) units and financial inclusion managers from banks, alongside key stakeholders from Egypt’s financial ecosystem, including the Credit Guarantee Company (CGC), the Egyptian Credit Bureau (i-Score) and the Egyptian Banking Institute (EBI). International experts also participated, sharing insights on the challenges of operationalising artificial intelligence (AI) and showcasing global use cases adapted to emerging markets.
The event marked the official launch of the MasterTalks series, with each session set to focus on a specific theme related to the digital transformation of the banking sector, with the overarching objective of advancing financial inclusion. Discussions underscored the importance of leveraging digital transformation to modernise banking operations and demonstrated how emerging technologies can be integrated into financial systems.
Participants also highlighted the role of AI-driven tools in expanding access to both financial and non-financial services for individuals and MSMEs, helping address their diverse needs and opening new opportunities for financially underserved and excluded segments.
The joint initiative reflects the CBE’s and EBRD’s shared commitment to supporting innovation, strengthening capacity building within the banking sector, and promoting inclusive and sustainable growth across Egypt’s financial system.
It also underscores the CBE’s strong focus on advancing financial inclusion in line with Egypt’s Vision 2030, as part of its broader efforts to achieve economic empowerment and expand access to financial and banking services. These efforts rely heavily on modern technological innovations to accelerate digital transformation across the financial and banking sectors.
As a result, Egypt has recorded a marked improvement in financial inclusion in recent years. As of June 2025, the financial inclusion rate reached 76.3%, representing a 214% increase since 2016. Over the same period, banks’ lending portfolios directed to MSMEs grew by 395%.

2025-12-14,Qatar’s Al Mana Holding to invest $200m in Egypt sustainable aviation fuel plant,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/14/qatars-al-mana-holding-to-invest-200m-in-egypt-sustainable-aviation-fuel-plant/,"Qatar’s Al Mana Holding signed a contract on Sunday to invest $200m in a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production plant in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE), marking the first Qatari industrial investment in the zone.
The project, which will be executed by the newly established “Saf Fly Limited”, aims to produce 200,000 tonnes annually of SAF, BioPropane, and Bio Naphtha derived from refined used cooking oil.
Al Mana Holding has secured a long-term supply agreement with Shell to purchase the facility’s entire production output, with supply scheduled to begin by the end of 2027.
Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, who witnessed the signing at the government headquarters in the New Administrative Capital, said the project reinforces the economic zone’s capabilities in adopting renewable energy sources and supports the aviation sector in line with global environmental standards.
The signing coincides with the Egyptian-Qatari Business Forum held in Cairo on Sunday. Madbouly noted that the deal demonstrates positive developments in relations between Cairo and Doha, reflecting a desire by both leaderships to boost bilateral ties and increase joint investments.
The facility will cover a total area of 100,000 square metres in the Sokhna Integrated Zone, split between 70,000 square metres in the industrial area and 30,000 square metres at Sokhna Port. The investment cost of $200m is equivalent to approximately EGP 9.6bn.
Walid Gamal El-Din, Chairperson of the SCZONE, stated that environmental sustainability is a core pillar of the zone’s strategy.
“The project leads to a reduction in harmful emissions by rates ranging between 50-80% compared to traditional fuel,” Gamal El-Din said, adding that the zone has become an optimal destination for investment due to its infrastructure, diverse energy sources, and legislative incentives.
Abdulaziz Al Mana, CEO of Al Mana Holding and Chairman of Green Sky Capital, praised Egypt’s investment climate and the support from political leadership in both nations, describing the project as a distinguished partnership.
The contract was signed by Captain Ahmed Gamal, SCZONE Vice Chairperson for the Southern Zone, and Saad Mohammed Al Mana, Board Member of Al Mana Holding.
The Sokhna Integrated Zone is one of four industrial zones and six ports comprising the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE).

2025-12-14,"Afro-Asian Investors Forum spotlights opportunities, challenges in Egypt’s tourism real estate",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/14/afro-asian-investors-forum-spotlights-opportunities-challenges-in-egypts-tourism-real-estate/,"Senior real estate developers, investors and industry experts convened at the Afro-Asian General Investors Union Forum to examine opportunities and challenges in Egypt’s real estate sector, with a particular focus on tourism-oriented properties and real estate exports.
Discussions centred on boosting Egypt’s global competitiveness, attracting foreign investment, and leveraging major national projects alongside digital solutions to support sustainable sectoral growth.
Chairperson of Business Bay Developments, Amir Sami, said the company is focused on delivering globally standardised commercial and hospitality products that are export-ready, targeting overseas businesspeople and international firms. He noted that Egypt has all the ingredients needed to export real estate, including a favourable climate, strong tourism appeal and an attractive investment environment, while stressing that the semi-finished property model is unsuitable for export markets.
Ehab El-Obeidi, CEO of Rayn Developments, said that despite Egypt’s strong fundamentals, such as political stability and a strategic geographic location, its share of global real estate trade remains just 2.5% of a $250bn market. He emphasised the need for closer integration between the private sector and the state to unlock the sector’s full potential, calling for tax incentives and stronger government support, particularly in light of an estimated shortfall of 200,000 hotel units.
Chairperson of Tayel Group Wissam Tayel said real estate exports represent a key channel for attracting foreign currency inflows. He highlighted the investment potential of Upper Egypt, citing growing demand driven by universities and entertainment activities, and called for activating the hotel apartment model in the region, which receives around 500,000 Arab visitors annually. He also urged the government to simplify procedures for converting residential and administrative units into hotel use.
Founder and CEO of Prime Hospitality Management Group Moataz Amin said recent government decisions allow residential and administrative properties to be licensed as hotel units under specific security, safety and hygiene standards, without fees for properties comprising more than eight units—provided they are operated by specialised companies.
Advisor to the Afro-Asian Investors Union for Urban Development Abdel Aziz El-Kafrawy revealed that the sector has successfully exported and sold units worth $1.9bn. He underscored the need to establish a dedicated regulatory authority for Egypt’s real estate market and to develop a clear master plan to attract foreign investors, particularly to Upper Egypt.
Meanwhile, Managing Director and Vice Chairperson of Al Taamir Mortgage Finance – Al Oula Ayman Abdel Hamid said mortgage financing helps legalise property documentation and reassures foreign investors through the foreign ownership registry, adding that after-sales services remain among the sector’s key challenges.
Several speakers stressed the importance of finishing standards, architectural identity, fire safety codes and professional operating models in enhancing property value and export readiness. Others highlighted the growing role of proptech, digital solutions and integrated asset management in shaping the future of real estate development.
The session concluded with broad consensus that exporting real estate is no longer solely about construction, but about creating integrated, digitally enabled assets that deliver sustainable value, enhance user experience and strengthen Egypt’s position as a competitive destination for global real estate investment.",503,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8043287992477417,2025-12-15T09:36:08.489718

The projects are expected to cover three main sectors: educational institutions, government-affiliated entities, and service, investment, and industrial projects, which typically require advanced fire safety systems compliant with both local and international standards.
Karim Ahmed, CEO of Intelli-Pro, said the 2026 targets build on the company’s performance in 2025, when it completed projects valued at approximately EGP 70m. He attributed the growth to rising demand for fire protection systems and growing investor awareness of occupational safety and risk management.
Ahmed noted that Egypt’s fire-fighting systems market grew by more than 15% in 2025, with expectations that growth could approach 20% in the coming year. Key drivers include improved currency stability and stricter compliance requirements in industrial and service developments.
He also highlighted the role of the Civil Defense Authority, pointing to recent enhancements in inspection and approval procedures that have streamlined project implementation while maintaining rigorous safety standards.
Commenting on the broader industry landscape, Ahmed said that expanding domestic manufacturing in fire safety systems would benefit from greater access to financing, particularly for new and emerging industrial projects, supporting local production and reducing reliance on imports.
Founded in 2019, Intelli-Pro operates in the design, supply, installation, and maintenance of fire-fighting systems, as well as electromechanical and low-current systems. The company has delivered fire protection solutions for over 70 organisations across Egypt in sectors including industrial, telecommunications, aviation, and education.

2025-12-15,"Legislative, technological reforms expand access to non-banking financial activities: FRA chair",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/15/legislative-technological-reforms-expand-access-to-non-banking-financial-activities-fra-chair/,"Mohamed Farid, Chairperson of the Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA), said that the development of legislative and regulatory frameworks, alongside the expansion of fintech applications, has played a pivotal role in widening the base of beneficiaries of non-banking financial activities, while empowering youth and women to actively participate in capital markets, insurance and investment activities.
Speaking at the Top 50 Women STEM and Future Innovation Summit, Farid said that public service faces increasingly complex challenges due to overlapping interests and a growing number of stakeholders. This reality, he noted, requires continuous effort supported by strong scientific and professional reference frameworks. He stressed that ongoing education and engagement with international experiences, particularly in advanced economies, are essential for understanding markets and communicating effectively with investors and global institutions using a shared professional language.
Farid added that anyone engaged in public service must demonstrate constant diligence and a commitment to lifelong learning. He explained that he personally followed this approach by earning four master’s degrees to continuously update his knowledge and remain closely aligned with global developments in the financial sector, particularly in advanced markets. This, he said, enables effective communication with international investors and institutions in terms they understand, emphasising that solid scientific and professional grounding is the cornerstone of effective regulatory work.
The FRA chair pointed out that there is a common misconception among some members of the public that they fully understand the nature of work carried out by public institutions. In reality, however, the scale and complexity of the challenges facing public authorities make it essential to engage with citizens, explain the reforms being implemented, and clarify how these reforms affect their daily lives. Achieving this level of engagement, he said, is not possible without strong academic foundations and accumulated professional experience.
Farid explained that the FRA is among the public authorities most closely connected to citizens’ everyday lives, given its supervision of sectors that directly affect their needs. These include compulsory and supplementary motor insurance, private insurance and pension funds, insurance brokerage firms, actuarial services companies and investment funds.
In this context, Farid highlighted the Authority’s experience with gold investment funds, which were launched in 2023 from a standing start. Within a relatively short period, these funds succeeded in attracting investments of between EGP 4bn and EGP 5bn from nearly 250,000 investors. Many participants began with relatively small investment amounts, reflecting the FRA’s success in achieving one of its core objectives: promoting investment democracy and making investment opportunities accessible to all segments of society.
Farid cited a quote attributed to Albert Einstein, noting that one of the major problems in societies is continuing to do the same thing while expecting different results. He recalled the state of Egypt’s insurance sector in 1999, when insurance premiums accounted for less than 1% of GDP, at approximately 0.9%, highlighting the limited penetration of insurance services at the time.
He added that average insurance penetration rates range between 5% and 7% in emerging markets, and between 12% and 15% in advanced economies. Egypt’s insurance sector at the time also suffered from a shortage of actuaries, a highly specialised profession, as well as difficulties in accessing qualified human capital.
The human-capital challenge extended to educational curricula for insurance intermediaries. Farid noted that insurance premiums showed virtually no growth for years, with the sector remaining stagnant until he assumed the chairmanship of the FRA in 2022.
He stressed that it was no longer acceptable to continue operating using the same traditional approach, limited to issuing a series of regulatory decisions. Instead, the Authority adopted a fundamentally different path, centred on updating educational curricula and information frameworks as a primary gateway to genuine and sustainable reform.
Farid explained that when assessing markets, any financial regulatory authority must adhere to two non-negotiable objectives. The first is maintaining financial stability, which he described as the primary responsibility of any financial regulator. The second is developing and expanding market size. He said that the reforms adopted by the FRA were designed to generate tangible impact across financing activities, capital markets and the insurance sector.
Understanding the characteristics of new generations, particularly Generation Z and Generation Alpha, was a key driver behind these reforms, Farid said. He explained that these generations no longer have the inclination or patience to complete traditional procedures, such as physically visiting brokerage firms to sign contracts. As a result, Law No. 5 of 2022 regulating the use of technology in non-banking financial activities was enacted, delivering comprehensive impact across products and markets.
Farid noted that amendments introduced under this framework significantly eased access for young people to invest in the stock market. Previously, the annual average number of new investors obtaining trading codes ranged between 25,000 and 29,000. This figure jumped to approximately 340,000 in 2023, followed by 240,000 in 2024, reaching 281,000 investors by October of the current year. He emphasised that this qualitative leap was driven by the digitalisation of know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, alongside a broader package of market reforms.
Turning to the insurance sector, Farid highlighted the significant capital gap that had persisted for years. In 2007, the minimum capital requirement for banks stood at EGP 500m, compared with just EGP 60m for insurance companies. By 2020, bank capital requirements had risen to EGP 5bn, while insurance companies’ minimum capital remained unchanged at EGP 60m.
To address this imbalance, the FRA worked on issuing the Unified Insurance Law, which consolidated four separate laws into a single legislative framework. Following extensive discussions lasting between two and three years, the law raised the minimum capital requirement for insurance companies from EGP 60m to EGP 750m, ensuring recapitalisation, strengthening insurers’ ability to bear risks and enabling the development of more advanced insurance products.
As a result of these reforms, Farid noted that three to four insurance companies have begun offering comprehensive motor insurance policies for new vehicles, with the ability to complete all procedures digitally from home.
He stressed that the combined impact of legislative, regulatory and technological reforms has driven rising demand for functions that have become critically important from a supervisory perspective, most notably internal audit, governance and compliance. As a regulator, the FRA requires these functions to be in place within the institutions it supervises, which currently number around 3,900 entities.
In this context, Farid highlighted the role of the FRA-affiliated Financial Services Institute in qualifying human capital through specialised training programmes. He also drew attention to the regulation of third-party administrator (TPA) companies managing healthcare programmes and their placement under direct regulatory supervision, contributing to market organisation and the protection of stakeholders’ rights.
Farid concluded his speech by stressing the importance of empowering women and youth, particularly in the fields of science, technology and innovation, describing them as a fundamental pillar for building a more efficient, resilient and sustainable financial future.",1131,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.7958733439445496,2025-12-16T09:29:04.386321

The event featured Janet Henry, HSBC’s Global Chief Economist, and Simon Williams, HSBC’s Chief Economist for Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa (CEEMEA), who shared insights on growth prospects, risks and emerging opportunities amid an increasingly complex global environment.
Opening the event, Todd Wilcox, Deputy Chairperson and CEO of HSBC Bank Egypt, said Egypt was entering a new phase of stability and opportunity as economic reforms begin to yield tangible results.
“Egypt is entering a new chapter of stability and opportunity. The reform programme is starting to crystallise into real economic improvements,” Wilcox said. “With clearer policies and a more flexible operating environment, we are seeing renewed investor confidence across sectors and trade corridors. Our role as business leaders is to accelerate this momentum and turn confidence into sustainable, long-term growth.”
Addressing global economic trends, Janet Henry said markets may be underestimating inflationary pressures. “With sticky inflation and a relatively resilient economy supported by fiscal stimulus, markets still appear to be pricing in too many interest-rate cuts in 2026,” she said.
Focusing on Egypt’s macroeconomic outlook, Simon Williams noted that while challenges remain, the ongoing rebalancing process is laying the groundwork for recovery. “It is too soon to relax, but the rebalancing now under way opens the door to a proper recovery next year,” he said. “Over the longer term, structural reform will be critical. If Egypt gets it right, it could become an 8% growth story. Failure to deliver, however, would cap growth and leave the economy vulnerable to fresh shocks.”
The Economist Roadshow continues to serve as a platform where global insight meets local opportunity, helping clients and partners navigate economic change, anticipate market shifts and identify pathways for sustainable growth. The event also reaffirmed HSBC’s role as a trusted partner supporting Egypt’s long-term vision for economic resilience, innovation and sustainable development.",345,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8458131551742554,2025-12-16T09:29:24.954310

Speaking at a meeting with export council heads and Investment Minister Hassan El-Khatib, Madbouly called on local and foreign investors to seize current opportunities.
“Double your investments… the climate is attractive… and the opportunities are vast and promising, so seize them,” Madbouly told the assembly.
Record Exports Narrow Deficit
El-Khatib reported that for the first ten months of 2025, Egypt achieved its lowest trade deficit in ten years. Non-petroleum exports rose to a record $40.7bn, driving a total trade volume of $107.6bn. The minister attributed the improved balance of trade primarily to a $6.5bn annual increase in exports rather than import compression, signalling a genuine expansion in productive capacity.
Ministry data indicates the trade deficit had already narrowed by 16% year-on-year in the first ten months of 2025, dropping to roughly $26.3bn. The surge in exports has been notably driven by the UAE, which emerged as the top destination for Egyptian goods with $6.3bn in imports—a staggering 142% year-on-year increase.
Garments and ‘Property Exports’ to Lead 2026 Growth
Export councils presented a bullish outlook for 2026, driven by foreign direct investment (FDI) and supply chain localisation. The ready-made garments sector is forecast to grow by 28% to 30% next year, supported by recent capital injections from Egyptian, Chinese, and Turkish investors.
Industry leaders are targeting $4bn in exports by 2026. The sector has seen a shift in regional dynamics, with exports to Turkey soaring by 71% and shipments to Saudi Arabia doubling in recent months, as manufacturers capitalise on near-shoring trends.
Similarly, real estate “exports”—sales of properties to foreign buyers—are projected to rise by 30%. Council heads cited demand from Egyptian expatriates and Gulf nationals, particularly for developments in the Red Sea and the North Coast, specifically mentioning Ras El Hekma and Alam El-Roum.
The sector continues to be energised by the historic $35bn Ras El Hekma deal with UAE sovereign fund ADQ. Furthermore, the mention of Alam El-Roum likely refers to the developing partnership with Qatari Diar, which recently committed to a multi-billion-dollar project in the area, solidifying the North Coast’s status as a magnet for Gulf capital.
Furniture and Agriculture
In the furniture sector, officials highlighted a new factory in New Alamein city set to supply IKEA branches globally. The plant contributes to the localisation of production inputs, a strategy officials said is reducing the import bill.
Meanwhile, the food industries sector is targeting export growth of 15% to 18% next year. The agriculture council aims for a minimum 10% annual increase, noting that local components already constitute 95% of production. These targets align with the state’s broader “Narrative for Economic Development,” which aims to increase annual export values by 20% through 2030.
Madbouly concluded the meeting by praising the private sector’s resilience. “You took risks and succeeded… so seize the opportunity,” he said. “All economic indicators are positive.”",508,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9448106288909912,2025-12-16T09:29:53.678437

The package also allows private-sector companies contributing to strategic projects to deduct interest on external loans from their taxable base. Additional measures include replacing capital gains tax with a stamp duty to stimulate investment and trading on the Egyptian Exchange, as well as offering tax incentives to encourage the listing of large and influential companies on the stock market for a three-year period.
Kouchouk made the remarks during a meeting with real estate developers, noting that the incentives are designed to ease tax burdens by simplifying procedures and fostering an environment of trust and certainty with the tax community.
He said the second reform package comprises 25 measures aimed at responding to the needs of compliant taxpayers and encouraging voluntary tax compliance.
The minister explained that the incentives cover a wide range of sectors, including real estate development. Addressing developers, he said: “We look forward to receiving your ideas on facilitating, simplifying, standardising and digitalising tax procedures. The real estate sector is a key driver of economic activity, and we are working with you to promote real estate exports.”
Kouchouk stressed the importance of establishing a joint high-level committee for the real estate development sector to review challenges and work towards practical solutions.
He also announced plans to launch a mobile application dedicated to real estate transactions, enabling notification and simplified payment of due taxes. He confirmed that the tax rate on real estate transactions for individuals will remain fixed at 2.5% of the unit’s sale value, regardless of the number of transactions, with no additional administrative burdens.
Kouchouk added that institutional reforms are under way to accelerate and simplify value-added tax refunds, improving liquidity for business partners.
The second package also includes incentives to encourage the voluntary closure of tax files for the 2023 and 2024 tax years under fixed and proportional tax systems, building on progress achieved in the previous year. In addition, the VAT rate on medical devices will be reduced from 14% to 5%.
Addressing concerns related to property tax, Kouchouk reassured developers that a separate incentive package is being approved to ease burdens on citizens. The proposed measures include allowing the cancellation of property tax during times of crisis, raising the exemption threshold for private residences to EGP 4m, enabling electronic payment of property tax, waiving late-payment penalties in specific cases, capping penalties at no more than the original tax due, and reforming and simplifying the appeals mechanism.",435,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.7065399885177612,2025-12-16T09:29:58.939525

Designed to address the diverse needs of women entrepreneurs at different stages of their business journey, the programme offers a comprehensive package of non-financial services. These include specialised training and hands-on advisory support aimed at strengthening leadership, managerial and financial capabilities. Key focus areas cover digital marketing, brand development, business management, financial literacy and leadership, equipping participants with practical tools to enhance sustainability and economic impact.
The Women in Business Empowerment Programme is offered exclusively to women entrepreneurs who are CIB clients, integrating non-financial services with tailored financial solutions to support business growth.
As part of the programme, CIB provides a range of banking products and services, including credit cards, business financing facilities on preferential terms and innovative funding solutions.

Yasser Abdallah, Deputy CEO for Retail and Commercial Banking at CIB, said the programme reflects the Bank’s strategic approach to women’s empowerment. “Supporting women entrepreneurs is not merely a social responsibility; it is a strategic investment in a more inclusive and sustainable future. Through our partnership with the EBRD, we are building an integrated ecosystem of non-financial services that aligns with the ambitions of businesswomen and equips them with practical tools to grow and compete with confidence.”
Hany El-Deeb, Head of Small and Medium Enterprises and Commercial Banking at CIB, said the initiative goes beyond access to finance. “The programme focuses on capacity building alongside financing, covering critical areas such as management, financial literacy and business development. This holistic approach enables women-led businesses to achieve both financial and non-financial objectives, strengthening their contribution to a more inclusive and sustainable economy.”
The first phase of the programme will focus on marketing strategies and brand building, with additional specialised tracks to be rolled out across multiple disciplines over the coming year.

El-Husseiny noted that the programme builds on the EBRD’s longstanding support for women entrepreneurs, adding that CIB continues to reinforce its position as a leading bank in delivering non-financial services tailored to the needs of women in business.
He added that investing in women’s empowerment is a cornerstone of sustainable development and economic growth, stressing that the programme reflects the EBRD’s vision of translating empowerment into lasting impact by supporting women at different stages of their professional journey.

Speaking at a conference on economic competitiveness, Al-Mashat stated that reforms supporting growth and employment “will not cease” as the country transitions from managing challenges to consolidating stability.
To support fiscal discipline, the minister noted that the government adhered to an investment spending ceiling of EGP 1trn in the 2024/25 fiscal year. Preliminary indicators showed actual public investments amounted to EGP 922bn, representing 92% of the target.
Al-Mashat said this governance of public investment has reduced burdens on the general budget and debt, creating space for the private sector to increase its share to 63% of total investments in the current fiscal year.
“Economic policy has become more predictable, enhancing the confidence of the business community and investors,” Al-Mashat said, adding that “2026 will witness a different shift for the Egyptian economy”.
Concessional financing provided to the private sector since 2020 has exceeded $15bn, according to the minister. This included $5bn through the “NWFE” energy programme, which provided financing to companies including Infinity Power, AMEA Power, ACWA Power, and Scatec.
Looking ahead, Al-Mashat said the ministry is working with the Ministry of Finance to prepare the Economic and Social Development Plan and a Medium-Term Budget Framework for 2026/27–2029/30. This will be linked to performance methodologies to ensure spending efficiency.
The minister added that the coming period will see €1.8bn in additional financing through the European Investment Guarantee mechanism, alongside further equity investments by international institutions.
Regarding structural changes, Al-Mashat said the state is continuing labour market reforms and has adopted a unified definition for start-ups to allow companies to benefit from government incentives.

Speaking on Tuesday at the Conference on the Competitiveness of the Egyptian Economy in Cairo, Sawiris said an Italian company has expressed interest in forming a consortium with one of his affiliated firms to bid for the management and operation of Hurghada International Airport, which the government has recently offered to private investors.
Sawiris said he is also open to competing for the management of other airports if they are offered, particularly Luxor and Sohag airports.
He added that upgrading and professionally managing airports, alongside other incentives supporting the tourism sector, could help double the number of tourists visiting Egypt in the coming years.
Sawiris also outlined his investment plans for the next phase, which include new projects in Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq.
“We are looking to acquire a new plot of land in the UAE following the major success of my first project there, with investments of $15bn,” Sawiris said.
Beyond the UAE, he added that his group aims to transfer its experience in replacing traditional tuk-tuks in Egypt with electric alternatives to Morocco. “We seek to replicate the model by replacing diesel-powered motorcycles with electric ones,” he said.
In Egypt, Sawiris said future expansions are likely to focus on the tourism sector. He plans to develop three hotels in the Giza Pyramids area and in the governorates of Minya and Sohag.
He ruled out launching new real estate developments, noting that his company is currently focused on completing existing projects.
Sawiris also renewed his criticism of high interest rates in Egypt, describing them as harmful to the sector. He said interest costs account for roughly half the cost of real estate projects in the country.",310,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.5775660276412964,2025-12-17T09:31:46.418227

The agreement was signed by Mohamed Medhat, Deputy CEO of MSMEDA, and Ahmed Labib, Managing Director and CEO of Reefy, in the presence of Basel Rahmy, CEO of MSMEDA.
Rahmy said the Agency is expanding financing for micro projects due to their vital role in creating job opportunities across productive, agricultural, and service sectors. He noted that MSMEDA is keen to cooperate with specialised institutions with proven expertise in microfinance, given their ability to reach target groups across all governorates, villages, and hamlets, and effectively meet their financing needs. This approach, he added, has contributed to increasing the number of funded projects.
Rahmy stressed MSMEDA’s commitment to implementing the State’s direction and the directives of Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, Chairperson of the Agency’s Board, to scale up financing for micro projects in light of their importance in generating employment opportunities, particularly for young people.
He explained that cooperation with Reefy aims to channel financing through the company’s network of 220 branches nationwide, supporting citizens and youth in establishing new micro projects, as well as enabling existing businesses to develop, expand, replace, or renew their activities through access to funding. This, he said, contributes to improving living standards for both project owners and workers.
Rahmy added that financing for a single project can reach up to EGP 266,000, depending on funding requirements, noting that the agreement is expected to finance around 3,000 micro projects across various governorates.
For his part, Ahmed Labib said the agreement aligns with the State’s efforts to enhance financial inclusion and integrate vulnerable groups who do not engage with the banking sector into the formal financial system, thereby supporting sustainable economic development.
Labib added that Reefy is working to expand access to financial services, particularly in villages, rural areas, and Upper Egypt, with a special focus on women and young people. This, he said, supports the State’s vision of empowering micro enterprises and increasing their contribution to the national economy.",351,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8935662508010864,2025-12-17T09:33:08.319485

He said the Ministry is currently working on the launch of a unified digital business platform that will integrate company incorporation, licensing, payments, and financial and customs obligations into a single, comprehensive system.
The platform is designed to significantly reduce the number of procedures and the time required to complete them, enhance transparency and efficiency, and strengthen trust between the State and investors.
El-Khatib made the remarks during a forum organised by Lynx Consulting, attended by Mohamed El-Gouski, Assistant Minister of Investment and Foreign Trade for Planning, Development, and Digital Transformation; Amani El-Wassal, Head of the Agreements and Foreign Trade Sector; Mohamed Hanafi, Managing Director of Lynx Consulting; Moataz Yaken, an expert on Egyptian economic affairs; alongside senior ministry officials, business leaders, investors, and private-sector representatives.
During the forum, El-Khatib outlined Egypt’s strategy to improve the investment and trade environment, expand exports to African markets, and enhance trade competitiveness. He highlighted the government’s vision and forward-looking plans to achieve these objectives.
The Minister said Egypt has laid solid foundations in recent years to build a more competitive economy, noting that the government has adopted economic policies characterised by stability and transparency. These policies, he explained, enable investors to make informed decisions with confidence, while providing a clear understanding of the State’s direction and its executive and institutional framework.
On monetary policy, El-Khatib said the primary objective has been to curb inflation and restore monetary discipline. These efforts have borne fruit, with inflation declining to around 11.6% in June 2025. Foreign currency reserves have risen to $50bn, while net foreign assets have shifted from a deficit to a surplus exceeding $10bn.
Regarding fiscal policy, he said the State has focused on rebuilding confidence, easing financial pressures on investors, and improving tax revenues through enhanced collection efficiency and an expanded tax base. These measures resulted in a 35% increase in tax revenues without imposing any new burdens.
El-Khatib also stressed that Egypt has adopted a trade policy based on greater openness to global markets. Reforms have reduced customs clearance time and costs by 65%, with plans to reach a 90% reduction in the coming period, cutting average clearance time to just two days. He added that the removal of several non-tariff barriers has saved the Egyptian economy more than $1.5bn during the current year.
The Minister highlighted Egypt’s key competitive advantages, including low production costs, a large and skilled workforce, advanced infrastructure, and a strategic geographic location. These strengths, he said, reinforce confidence in the economy’s ability to achieve higher and sustainable growth rates with tangible benefits for citizens.
For his part, Mohamed El-Gouski outlined the Ministry’s plans to deepen trade integration with Africa through regional agreements and economic blocs such as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and COMESA. He also highlighted efforts to strengthen the role of commercial representation offices across African markets and to optimise the use of Jisr Company’s assets.
El-Gouski said the Ministry initially targeted increasing trade exchange with selected African countries based on clearly defined criteria linked to each country’s competitive advantages.
He added that the Ministry has worked to address challenges facing trade expansion in Africa by developing maritime and land connectivity supported by logistics zones; coordinating with the Central Bank of Egypt to strengthen the presence of Egyptian banks on the continent; utilising export rebate programmes to support Egyptian companies; organising trade missions and permanent exhibitions across Africa; and enhancing institutional coordination by unifying the roles of entities involved in foreign trade.
The forum concluded with an extensive interactive discussion addressing key issues related to boosting Egypt’s export competitiveness, policy frameworks, and private-sector perspectives. Participants also explored opportunities to expand exports to Africa, required logistics and financing solutions, and ways to promote sustainable and green exports in line with the standards of emerging African markets.",665,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9104154706001282,2025-12-18T09:30:17.360940

Backed by 43 development partners, the replenishment reflects a 23% increase over the previous cycle, achieved despite tight global fiscal conditions and shrinking aid budgets. The outcome underscores renewed confidence in Africa’s development trajectory and in the African Development Bank Group’s leadership and evolving financing approach.
“This is not just a replenishment—it is a turning point,” said Sidi Ould Tah, President of the African Development Bank Group. “In one of the most challenging global environments for development finance, our partners chose ambition over retrenchment, and investment over inertia.”
For the first time in the ADF’s history, 23 African countries contributed directly, pledging a combined $182.7m—five times the level of the previous cycle. Nineteen countries contributed for the first time, alongside long-standing regional supporters.
“This is transformational,” Ould Tah said. “Africa is no longer only a beneficiary of concessional finance. Africa is a co-investor in its own future.”
ADF-17 introduces a significant shift in how concessional resources are deployed. Partners endorsed a new financial framework enabling the Fund to leverage its balance sheet, operationalise a Market Borrowing Option, employ innovative instruments such as hybrid capital, and use concessional resources to absorb risk and crowd in private investment.
Currently, every dollar invested through the Fund mobilises more than $2.50 in co-financing and private capital—a ratio expected to increase under the new model.
“This enables concessional finance to do what it does best—absorb risk, unlock private capital and accelerate development at scale,” Ould Tah added.
ADF-17 also anchors a new generation of scaled, risk-sharing partnerships. Major commitments include up to $800m from the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) and up to $2bn from the OPEC Fund for International Development, significantly enhancing the Fund’s ability to drive transformational projects in difficult operating environments.
Resources mobilised under ADF-17 will support 37 low-income and fragile African countries, with priorities including energy access, food system resilience, human capital, regional integration and trade, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Targeted support will continue for countries facing fragility and vulnerability, including through the Transition Support Facility.
The record replenishment positions the African Development Fund at the centre of a new era of African ownership, risk-sharing and investment-driven development, further reinforcing its role as a catalyst for sustainable growth across the continent.",413,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8426740765571594,2025-12-18T09:30:34.861373

Chief among the approvals was the granting of Golden Licenses to two strategic projects worth a combined EGP 15.1bn.
The first was awarded to MAC for Light Transport Manufacturing to establish an integrated automotive complex in New October City, adjacent to the 6th of October Dry Port. The EGP 6.3bn project will encompass the production and assembly of passenger cars, light and medium transport vehicles, buses, components, spare parts, tyres, and painting facilities.
The project is expected to generate around 1,000 jobs, achieve a local component share starting at 42%, export at least half of its output, and commence operations by early 2027—supporting the state’s drive to localise automotive manufacturing and advance electric mobility.
A second Golden License was granted to Deli Egypt for Industry to establish a factory for office supplies, school tools and children’s sports products in 10th of Ramadan City. Valued at EGP 8.8bn, the facility marks the global Deli Group’s first investment in Egypt and is projected to create 2,200 jobs. The project is expected to source more than 50% of its inputs locally and export at least 50% of production, with completion slated for February 2027.
In the energy sector, the Cabinet approved a draft presidential decree for a new petroleum exploration and production agreement in the Integrated Badr El-Din area in the Western Desert, with minimum investments of $208 million. Plans include drilling 44 wells and targeting monthly output of 105,000 barrels of oil and 1.2bn cubic feet of gas—reducing Egypt’s import bill by an estimated $25m per month.
The Cabinet also endorsed a $10m grant from the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development to finance projects in Sohag, and a $4.3m grant from South Korea to support green-energy infrastructure in the Suez Canal—covering LNG bunkering and training facilities—aligned with efforts to develop a sustainable canal corridor by 2030.
Additional approvals covered Egypt’s hosting of the 24th Conference of the Parties to the Barcelona Convention, accession to the D-8 Preferential Trade Agreement, land allocation in Sadat City for logistics development, authorisation of commemorative gold and silver coins marking 150 years of the State Lawsuits Authority, and updated compensation rates for public contracts.

Speaking at a weekly press conference, Madbouly stated that non-oil exports recorded approximately $40bn in 2024. He affirmed that the national target to increase total exports—including both goods and services—to $145bn by 2030 is achievable in terms of both timing and volume.
The Prime Minister highlighted that the country has recorded its lowest trade deficit in the last ten years, attributing this improvement to the government’s ongoing coordination with export councils to resolve challenges facing exporters.
Investment and Industry
Madbouly announced that the government is finalising a new package of investment facilities and incentives, which President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi is expected to announce soon. These measures aim to improve the investment climate and support the competitiveness of the Egyptian economy.
Regarding the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE), Madbouly noted that the zone has recently attracted investments worth $13.5bn. He singled out the Qantara West area as a promising model, with exports from the zone projected to exceed $4 billion in the coming period.
Poverty and Social Impact
Addressing social indicators, Madbouly revealed that the latest official statistics show approximately 29% of Egyptians live below the poverty line.
He acknowledged that economic reform programmes implemented to strengthen the national economy had contributed to a “slight increase” in this percentage. However, he stated that the state is working to mitigate the social impact of these reforms by lowering prices of food products and commodities, while ensuring a stable environment for investors.
Madbouly promised a “qualitative leap” in the level of services provided to citizens in the coming years as part of the state’s comprehensive development plans.
Economic Context
The Prime Minister described 2024 as an “exceptional year by all measures” regarding economic difficulties, particularly affecting the real estate, home appliances, and durable goods markets. He argued that discussions on economic recession must be contextualised, noting that inflation is a global phenomenon affecting even the most advanced nations.
Separately, Madbouly highlighted the involvement of Italian energy group Eni in supporting Egypt’s healthcare infrastructure. He said the company’s work establishing advanced medical facilities reflects a shared vision between the state and its international partners to prioritise human development and health.",388,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9487179517745972,2025-12-18T09:30:51.351016

The Group also unveiled nearly $500m in new investments and strategic partnerships in the manufacturing of home appliances, electronics and related components, in cooperation with leading global companies.
The new partnerships include Japan’s Sharp and Hitachi, Italy’s La Germania and Hoover, and China’s TCL, alongside ElAraby Group’s own brands: Egypt’s Tornado, Japan’s Kajitsu and Germany’s Heller.
ElAraby explained that ending its contracts with Toshiba in the home appliances and television sectors is part of the natural evolution of the global business landscape and reflects the Group’s restructuring of its international partnerships.
The company affirmed its full commitment to maintaining after-sales services for all products sold under ElAraby’s warranty, stressing that its dedication to customer service remains unchanged regardless of partnership changes or investment strategies.
The Group emphasised that its success over more than six decades has never been dependent on a single brand. It highlighted the establishment of the largest research and development centre in the Middle East—with investments exceeding EGP 3bn—dedicated to designing and developing home appliances and electronics for both domestic manufacturers and major global brands.
ElAraby noted that its growth in recent years, both in local industrial expansion and in forging new international partnerships, includes major agreements and projects approaching $500m in home appliance manufacturing.

He noted that the business climate is steadily improving and invited local and international partners to expand their investments in Egypt.
Speaking at a meeting with members of the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kouchouk said the government is targeting investment across productive, export-led and technology-driven sectors, with the aim of positioning Egypt as a regional hub for production and exports. He added that the Ministry is working to reduce the debt of budgetary entities to below 80% of GDP by June 2026, noting that a clearly defined and more ambitious strategy is underway to improve government debt indicators. This strategy, he explained, is based on innovative financing tools and strengthened coordination among state institutions.
Kouchouk highlighted the private sector’s proven capacity for competitiveness and its leading role in driving economic momentum. He pointed to a 73% increase in private investment last year, reflecting the injection of billions of Egyptian pounds into productive projects.
“We have chosen a path based on trust and partnership with the tax community, and we are continuing to simplify procedures to encourage voluntary compliance,” he said. He noted that a 35% increase in tax revenues last year was achieved without imposing new burdens, reflecting stronger economic activity and a positive response from the private sector.
The Minister stressed that the government is working to create additional fiscal space to strengthen social protection, increase allocations for human development, expand social spending, and direct resources to key sectors such as healthcare and the treatment of critical cases.
“I would like to thank the private sector. Together, we are moving in the right direction to enhance the competitiveness of our economy,” Kouchouk concluded.
For his part, Eric Chevallier, the French Ambassador to Egypt, said ongoing tax and customs reforms are reinforcing a climate of trust and partnership with international investors. He noted that the Egyptian economy is moving in a positive direction, with improving growth and declining inflation, and highlighted government support for expanding the global reach of Egyptian exports.
Meanwhile, Emad El-Sonbaty, Chairman of the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Egypt, expressed his appreciation to the Minister for his commitment to maintaining dialogue with the French business community as part of wider efforts to strengthen partnerships with local and foreign investors.
El-Sonbaty said the business community is looking forward to greater clarity and stability in fiscal and tax policy, continued simplification of administrative procedures, accelerated digital transformation, and the preservation of institutionalised dialogue with the private sector.

The platform is designed to provide a secure digital system for property exports, ensuring transparency and investor protection through a unified regulatory framework. Madbouly stated that the government is prioritising real estate investment to sustain high growth rates in the sector and meet rising international demand.
The first phase of the platform features more than 3,000 units in New Alamein City, all of which have been issued unique real estate identification numbers. Communications and Information Technology Minister Amr Talaat said the system is linked to the national property registry to verify ownership and prevent fraudulent transactions.
“The platform aims to regulate property exports through a unified framework, achieving transparency and credibility by providing a clear and organised market,” Talaat said. He added that future phases would expand geographically to include the New Administrative Capital, New Mansoura, New Rashid, Sawari, and Sheikh Zayed.
Housing Minister Sherif El-Sherbiny confirmed that the ministry has coordinated with the Central Bank of Egypt Governor to establish mechanisms for opening and managing bank accounts for developers. This move aims to regulate financial flows related to property sales to foreign buyers.
Minister of Justice Adnan Fangari said a draft resolution on real estate transactions has been prepared to include all necessary facilities for buyers. He noted that the ministry’s involvement provides a guarantee to international purchasers against the multiple sale of single units.
Investment and Foreign Trade Minister Hassan El-Khatib noted that the country is well-positioned to attract significant investment in the sector. He highlighted ongoing government efforts to streamline residency permits and property registration processes for those purchasing through the platform.

2025-12-19,From Miami Sands to Brussels Boardrooms: The High-Stakes Gambit for Ukraine’s Future,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/19/from-miami-sands-to-brussels-boardrooms-the-high-stakes-gambit-for-ukraines-future/,"As the winter sun sets over Miami this weekend, a series of discreet meetings in the Florida heat may well determine the fate of a frozen conflict thousands of miles away. While holidaymakers occupy the beaches, envoys from Washington, Moscow, and Kyiv are converging on the city, marking a clandestine but critical chapter in the effort to end the war in Ukraine.
Contents
The Miami Connection
The Brussels Standoff
Putin’s Frontline Pressure
A Broader European Horizon
The diplomatic flurry comes at a moment of extreme volatility. In Moscow, President Vladimir Putin is projecting a position of strength, insisting his forces hold the “strategic initiative” across the entire front line. Meanwhile, in Brussels, European leaders are locked in what has been described as a “last chance” summit to prevent Ukraine’s economy from collapsing under the weight of a looming €71.7bn budget deficit.
By the time the European Council concludes its two-day session on Friday, the central question of the conflict will have shifted from whether a deal is possible to who will pay for it and what guarantees will remain. This convergence of Trump-led diplomacy in the United States and financial desperation in Europe represents the most significant pivot in the war’s trajectory since the 2022 war, as the international community tests the viability of a ceasefire against the harsh realities of territorial concessions and frozen billions.
The Miami Connection
Kirill Dmitriev, an envoy for President Putin, is expected to arrive in Miami on Sunday for talks with US President-elect Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and his advisor and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. According to sources familiar with the arrangements reported by
Axios
, the meeting aims to brief the Russian side on progress made during recent discussions between US and Ukrainian officials.
Parallel to this, a Ukrainian delegation led by National Security Council Secretary Rustem Umerov is also expected in Miami this week. While no trilateral meeting is currently planned, the proximity of the actors suggests a “shuttle diplomacy” approach. The talks follow intensive negotiations in Berlin, where the framework of the Trump peace plan began to evolve from a proposal that initially shocked Kyiv with demands for territorial concessions to one now focused on “NATO-style” security guarantees.
“For the first time since 2022, a ceasefire is possible,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz noted during a recent press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is expected to brief EU leaders on the progress of these American-led talks.
The Brussels Standoff
Across the Atlantic, the atmosphere is considerably more strained. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has staked her reputation on a breakthrough regarding Ukraine’s funding. “I will not leave the Council without a solution for Ukraine’s financing,” she told reporters as she arrived in Brussels.
The primary obstacle is €210bn in frozen Russian assets, the vast majority of which are held in the Brussels-based financial institution Euroclear. The EU hopes to use these assets as collateral for a massive loan to Kyiv. However, Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever remains resistant, fearing legal retaliation from Moscow and financial instability.
The internal divisions are stark. Italy, Bulgaria, and Malta have expressed reservations, while Belgium’s ambassador reportedly told his counterparts that the country is “stepping backwards” from the proposal. If a consensus on assets fails, the EU is considering a “Plan B”: issuing joint debt backed by the EU budget. This path would likely exclude Hungary and Slovakia, allowing 25 of the 27 member states to move forward independently.
Putin’s Frontline Pressure
While diplomats haggle over interest rates and security clauses, Vladimir Putin used his annual “Results of the Year” press conference to signal that Russia remains unmoved by Western pressure. He claimed his forces are advancing rapidly toward Zaporizhzhia and have secured “full control” of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region.
“The Russian army holds the strategic initiative in its entirety,” Putin said, adding that the capture of Pokrovsk (referred to by Moscow as Krasnoarmeysk) is “extremely important” for launching further offensive operations.
Despite his aggressive military posture, Putin offered a rare nod to Donald Trump, stating the US President-elect is making “sincere efforts” to end the war. However, the Russian leader remained firm on the ground reality: “The ball is in the court of the West and Ukraine.”
A Broader European Horizon
The summit in Brussels is not merely a war council; it is a test of European resilience in a changing global order. Beyond the immediate crisis in Ukraine, leaders are grappling with:
Economic Competitiveness:
Responding to aggressive trade policies from both the US and China, particularly regarding rare earth minerals.
Expansion:
Pushing forward the membership bids of Western Balkan nations, with Montenegro aiming for accession by 2028.
The Mercosur Hurdle:
Navigating French and Italian opposition to a long-delayed trade deal with South American nations, which Denmark hopes to sign by December 20.
As the summit nears its conclusion, the draft recommendations suggest the EU will commit to “strong and credible security guarantees” for Ukraine. It is a phrase intended to reassure Kyiv that even if Washington pursues a separate peace, Brussels will not retreat.
The “kicker” remains the timeline. With Ukraine facing a cash shortfall as early as April, the diplomatic theatre playing out from the sun-drenched offices of Miami to the late-night corridors of Brussels is no longer a matter of policy—it is a race against the spring thaw.",891,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.6778974533081055,2025-12-20T09:22:48.864322
2025-09-23,Cityscape 2025: Unlocking Egypt’s real estate potential,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/09/23/cityscape-2025-unlocking-egypts-real-estate-potential/,"As Egypt’s real estate sector faces rapid transformation, strong demand continues to intersect with financing challenges, urban expansion, and the rise of new investment models. At the forefront of this evolution is Cityscape 2025—positioned not just as a real estate exhibition, but as a strategic platform to drive dialogue, innovation, and investment.
In this interview, Hany Khafagy, General Manager of Informa Egypt, discusses how Cityscape is enabling growth in the sector and outlines the opportunities and challenges shaping the future of Egyptian real estate.
Does Egypt’s real estate sector need more incentives to drive growth?
Egypt’s real estate market holds tremendous growth potential, but it does require more targeted incentives. These include improved financing mechanisms, streamlined property registration, and stronger support for exporting real estate abroad. Cityscape 2025 directly addresses these needs through initiatives like Cityscape Talks for policy dialogue, the Egypt PropTech Challenge to support startups, and the International Pavilion to connect with a broader investor base. These tools are critical in sustaining momentum and driving growth in key areas such as the New Administrative Capital, New Cairo, and the North Coast.
What is the significance of Cityscape 2025 for Egypt?
Cityscape is more than an exhibition—it’s a global platform that reflects Egypt’s urban transformation. It showcases milestone developments in cities like the New Administrative Capital, New Alamein, and the North Coast. More importantly, it positions Egypt as a top real estate investment destination, encouraging foreign investment and promoting real estate exports. The event also strengthens collaboration between developers, investors, and government entities, signaling confidence in the sector as a pillar of national economic growth.
How would you assess the current state of Egypt’s real estate sector, especially amid rising prices?
Despite economic fluctuations and recent price hikes driven by local and global pressures, demand for real estate in Egypt remains strong. The sector continues to be viewed as a safe and stable investment—by Egyptians, expatriates, and regional investors alike. New urban developments like the New Administrative Capital and New Alamein offer a wide range of residential, commercial, and tourism options, catering to diverse market needs. This sustained demand underscores the sector’s resilience and long-term potential.
How can Egypt capitalize on the current real estate boom to shape the sector’s future?
This boom is a strategic opportunity to build a more sustainable and innovative real estate sector. By focusing on smart urban planning, integrated infrastructure, and tech-driven development, Egypt can unlock long-term value. Attracting foreign capital, expanding real estate exports, and introducing innovative financing models will further strengthen the sector’s role in economic development and solidify Egypt’s position on the global real estate map.
Hany Khafagy
Has the sector become more resilient, or have companies simply adapted to new realities?
It’s a combination of both. The real estate sector has proven to be highly resilient, supported by strong underlying demand. At the same time, developers have adapted by embracing new financing tools and shifting toward more integrated, lifestyle-oriented communities. There’s also a growing emphasis on smart technologies, sustainability, and flexible offerings—all of which enhance the sector’s ability to weather economic challenges. Cityscape 2025 contributes significantly by showcasing these solutions and facilitating dialogue that helps align the industry with global trends.
Is competition in the sector pushing developers to offer more customer-centric solutions?
Absolutely. Intense competition is driving developers to become more creative and responsive. We’re seeing extended payment plans, more flexible financing options, and exclusive offers during events like Cityscape. These initiatives not only give customers better choices, but also help maintain strong sales activity—even in uncertain economic times. In the end, this competition raises the bar for the entire sector.
What are the key topics that will be addressed at Cityscape Talks 2025?
Cityscape Talks 2025 will spotlight the most pressing and promising issues in Egypt’s real estate landscape. Discussions will cover landmark projects like the New Administrative Capital and Ras El Hekma, while exploring themes such as property pricing, financing mechanisms, investment trends, and PropTech innovation. Industry leaders, developers, policymakers, and investors will offer insights and practical strategies to drive the sector forward.
What advice would you give to real estate buyers and industry players?
For buyers, the key is to assess your needs and financial capabilities carefully before making a purchase. Look beyond short-term offers and focus on long-term value. For developers, it’s crucial to design products that resonate with new market segments—especially younger generations—and to maintain pricing strategies aligned with real purchasing power. Flexibility, innovation, and a deep understanding of evolving customer expectations will be essential for long-term success.",754,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.5719684362411499,2025-12-20T09:23:20.992458

Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation Minister Rania Al-Mashat and Local Development Minister Manal Awad, who is also acting Environment Minister, inspected the facility alongside Sohag Governor Abdul Fattah Serag. The visit focused on the Al-Radwan International Engineering Industries factory, which represents a $5m investment on a 5,000-square-metre site, producing compressors with capacities ranging from 1/10 to 3/4 horsepower.
Project officials stated that the plant currently operates with 40% local components, with plans to increase this to 70% to reduce the national import bill. Governor Serag noted that the project aims to meet domestic demand and export to markets including Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Sudan, Yemen, and Libya.
The West Gerga industrial zone spans 1,089 acres and is located 8km from Sohag International Airport and 50km from Sohag city. It currently houses 223 factories with an occupancy rate of 94.7%. Industrial Development Authority representatives reported that general infrastructure development at the site cost EGP 633m, while integrated utility networks—including water, sewage, electricity, telecommunications, natural gas, and fire systems—accounted for an additional EGP 605m.
The zone includes a complex for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) featuring 178 units that provide approximately 2,000 direct jobs. Its first phase covers 270 acres across 248 plots dedicated to engineering, mining, building materials, textiles, and ready-made garments. An additional 64-acre northern expansion is currently being equipped with utilities.
Minister Al-Mashat said the project reflects the state’s strategy to establish integrated industrial infrastructure and increasethe contribution of Upper Egypt governorates to the gross domestic product. She added that the Local Development Program in Upper Egypt (PLDUE) aligns with the “National Narrative for Economic Development and International Cooperation” to promote growth and job creation through sectoral interventions and production clusters.
Minister Awad highlighted that the PLDUE has injected approximately EGP 1.6bn into the West Gerga zone. She noted that these investments have improved occupancy rates and the quality of industries by leveraging the zone’s proximity to the Western Desert Road and the high-speed electric rail line. Awad stated that current infrastructure investments would also serve a planned 500-acre expansion.
The delegation included Hisham El-Helbawy, Assistant Minister of Local Development and Director of the PLDUE, Ahmed El-Sayes, the governorate’s Secretary General, and Mohamed Helmy, the Assistant Secretary General, alongside other executive and local leaders.
Governor Serag concluded that the efforts are part of a state vision to enhance integrated development in Upper Egypt and create a supportive environment for investment and sustainable employment for the governorate’s residents.",454,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7365986108779907,2025-12-20T09:23:51.388388

The milestone reflects CIB’s ongoing commitment to nurturing young talent and promoting the exchange of banking expertise between Egypt and Kenya.
The programme is being implemented as part of a strategic partnership between Commercial International Bank and the Kenya Bankers Association, established under a memorandum of understanding signed at the beginning of 2025. The agreement aims to develop Kenyan youth and empower the next generation of financial professionals, contributing to the creation of highly skilled banking cadres capable of shaping the future of Africa’s financial sector.
Spanning six consecutive months, the third edition of the programme delivered intensive, specialized training covering core banking principles, with a strong focus on credit fundamentals and technology-driven banking solutions. Participants also received hands-on training in credit analysis, risk assessment, and sound lending decision-making, equipping them with practical skills aligned with international banking standards.
A total of 22 young professionals from Kenya successfully completed all stages of the programme, qualifying them to make a meaningful contribution to the banking and financial services market in East Africa. The graduates are expected to play an active role in strengthening institutional capabilities and supporting sustainable growth within the sector.
The initiative reflects CIB’s expanding footprint and strategic presence in Kenya since its entry into the market in 2020. It also aligns with the broader efforts of the Egyptian State, led by the Central Bank of Egypt, to promote African banking integration, enhance financial sector cooperation, and invest in human capital development through the transfer of expertise and knowledge sharing.
The programme concluded with an official graduation ceremony held in Nairobi, attended by representatives from CIB’s executive management in both Egypt and Kenya, alongside senior officials from the Kenya Bankers Association, representatives of the Central Bank of Kenya, and members of the Egyptian Embassy in Nairobi.

Abdallah made the remarks while attending the signing ceremony of a partnership agreement between the Fund and Misr Life Insurance Company to implement the “Misr Ma‘akom” initiative. The initiative aims to provide comprehensive financial support for the minor children of martyrs, victims, and those injured in military, terrorist, and security operations from the Armed Forces and the Police.
The ceremony was attended by El-Sayed El-Ghaly, Chairperson of the Board of Trustees of the Fund; Mohamed Farid, Chairperson of the Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA); and senior officials from the Central Bank of Egypt, the FRA, the Fund, and Misr Life Insurance Company.
The agreement was signed by Ahmed Mohamed El-Ashaal, Executive Director of the Fund for Honouring Martyrs, and Mostafa El-Qammash, Managing Director and CEO of Misr Life Insurance Company.
The initiative is being launched in line with directives from President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, reflecting the Egyptian State’s firm commitment to supporting the families of martyrs, victims, and the injured, in recognition of the sacrifices they made to safeguard the nation’s security and stability.
Speaking at the event, CBE Governor Hassan Abdallah said the “Misr Ma‘akom” initiative embodies the State’s deep appreciation for those who gave their lives or were injured in defense of Egypt. He stressed that special attention is being given to minor children and injured minors to ensure they receive comprehensive and sustainable support.

He explained that implementation of the “Misr Ma‘akom” initiative will commence on 1 January 2026. Disbursements will be made to beneficiaries once they reach the age of 21, ensuring long-term financial security and stability.
Under the initiative’s framework, beneficiaries who reach the age of 21 by 30 June will receive their payments during the first week of July, while those who turn 21 by 31 December will receive their payments in the first week of January. El-Ghaly added that, God forbid, any new cases included in the Fund in the future will be enrolled in the initiative immediately and granted the same benefits.

According to a joint statement from Egypt’s Ministries of Industry and Transport, the meeting took place within the framework of the longstanding and brotherly relations between Egypt and the United Republic of Tanzania, in line with President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi’s directives to strengthen cooperation with African nations.
Al-Wazir met with Tanzanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mahmoud Thabit Kombo and Minister of Information, Culture and Sports Professor Yalamma Gamba John Kabudi, in the presence of senior officials from Egypt’s ministries of industry, transport, and foreign affairs.
During the talks, Al-Wazir reaffirmed Egypt’s commitment to expanding cooperation with Tanzania across various sectors, particularly industry and transport, emphasizing that bilateral relations are rooted in strong historical ties and close political relations between President Al-Sisi and Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan. He stressed that the proposed cooperation is based on integration rather than competition.
Key initiatives discussed included the establishment of a cargo terminal at Dar es Salaam Port through Egyptian companies, leveraging global shipping lines to enhance trade flows between the two countries.
The discussions also covered plans to develop an integrated livestock breeding complex, a modern slaughterhouse, and a leather tanning factory, alongside specialized facilities to improve production management and marketing efficiency.
These projects aim to increase the flow of Egyptian raw materials and manufactured goods to Tanzania, while facilitating the import of Tanzanian products into Egypt through major ports, including Sokhna, Safaga, and Dar es Salaam.
Both sides also explored the reciprocal establishment of logistics zones—one for Egypt in Tanzania and another for Tanzania in Egypt—modeled on Egypt’s successful experience with Rwanda. The initiative is expected to support joint investments, promote industrial cooperation, strengthen economic integration, and create employment opportunities for youth in both countries.
Al-Wazir highlighted Egypt’s extensive experience in infrastructure development, noting that Egyptian companies have delivered major projects domestically and internationally, including roads, bridges, airports, tunnels, and large-scale national developments. He affirmed their readiness to implement projects in Tanzania to the highest quality standards, within short timelines, and at competitive costs.
For his part, Tanzanian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo expressed appreciation for Egypt’s role in advancing bilateral cooperation, praising Egyptian expertise in industry, transport, infrastructure, and agriculture. He said the discussions paved the way for moving forward with the implementation of the proposed projects, which are expected to generate significant economic returns and employment opportunities.
Kombo added that steps will be taken in the coming period to finalize project frameworks, extending an official invitation to Al-Wazir to visit Tanzania for meetings with ministers of agriculture, transport, industry, and investment to formally launch and activate the projects.
Meanwhile, Minister of Information, Culture and Sports Professor Yalamma Gamba John Kabudi welcomed the outcomes of the meeting, emphasizing the strength of Egyptian-Tanzanian relations and affirming Tanzania’s full readiness to proceed with the joint initiatives, with intensified coordination expected in the period ahead.",512,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8064846992492676,2025-12-21T09:23:29.240519
2025-12-20,"Outstanding consumer finance hits EGP 74.9bn in 10M 2025, up 61.6% YoY: EFCF",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/20/outstanding-consumer-finance-hits-egp-74-9bn-in-10m-2025-up-61-6-yoy-efcf/,"The Egyptian consumer finance sector recorded unprecedented growth during the first 10 months of 2025, with outstanding balances reaching EGP 74.9bn, a year-on-year increase of 61.6%, according to the Egyptian Federation for Consumer Finance (EFCF). The strong performance reflects accelerating demand for regulated consumer credit, a sharp expansion in the customer base, and the continued maturity of the sector’s regulatory and risk-management framework.
Outstanding balances rose from EGP 47.4bn during the same period in 2024, marking growth of nearly 58%. Meanwhile, the number of consumers benefiting from licensed consumer finance companies surged from 3.27 million to 9.25 million, an increase of 182% year on year. The Federation attributed this rapid expansion to improved digital infrastructure, a broader and more diversified range of financing products, and rising confidence in the sector’s governance and supervisory environment.
Despite this exceptional growth, portfolio quality remained sound. Default rates were maintained at a stable 3-4%, underscoring the sector’s ability to scale responsibly while preserving disciplined credit standards. The EFCF described consumer finance as one of Egypt’s most regulated and resilient non-bank financial activities, playing an increasingly vital role in supporting household purchasing power and expanding access to formal financial services.
Growth under a robust regulatory framework
The Federation emphasized that the sector’s expansion is taking place within a well-defined regulatory structure overseen by the Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA). This framework has enabled consumer finance companies to respond to rising demand while ensuring transparency, consumer protection, and prudent risk management.
“These results confirm that consumer finance has evolved into a mature, well-supervised activity capable of meeting essential consumer needs without compromising stability,” the Federation said in a statement. It added that the sector has become a key pillar in Egypt’s broader financial inclusion strategy, particularly for first-time borrowers and underserved segments of the population.
The announcements were made during a press conference organized by the EFCF and attended by senior industry leaders, including Saeed Zaater, Chairperson of the Federation; Osama Farid, CEO of Premium Card; Ahmed Osama, Managing Director of Drive Finance; and Ali Abdel Wahab, Executive Director of Consumer Finance at B.TECH. All four executives are members of the Federation’s Board of Directors.
The speakers reviewed recent market developments, discussed regulatory priorities, and outlined the sector’s readiness for deeper digitalization and the phased adoption of Basel III capital adequacy standards.
Law No. 18 of 2020 reshaped the market
Saeed Zaater, Chairman of the Egyptian Federation for Consumer Finance, said that the sector’s transformation over recent years has been driven primarily by Law No. 18 of 2020, which laid the foundation for a transparent and rules-based consumer finance market.
“Law No. 18 of 2020 fundamentally reshaped the activity, moving it from an environment characterized by unstructured practices to a comprehensive regulatory framework,” Zaater said. “The law introduced full cost disclosure, prohibited hidden fees, guaranteed fair early-repayment rights, and imposed clear standards for licensing, governance, and risk management.”
He added that these reforms significantly strengthened consumer confidence, enhanced market discipline, and created a stable yet competitive environment that allows companies to grow responsibly while safeguarding customer rights. “This balance between growth and protection is what has enabled the sector to deliver sustainable expansion and consistently high service standards,” he noted.
Zaater also revealed that the Federation is working closely with the FRA and the banking sector to develop a unified credit database for consumer finance. The initiative aims to improve credit assessment processes, support smaller and first-time borrowers, and reinforce overall market stability by reducing information asymmetry.
Strong partnerships with banks
Ahmed Osama, Managing Director of Drive Finance and a member of the Federation’s Board of Directors, highlighted the critical role played by Egyptian banks in supporting the sector’s growth.
“The consumer finance sector today is built on a strong and structured partnership with the banking system,” Osama said. “Banks provide clearly defined credit facilities and financing programs that enable consumer finance companies to meet growing demand in a safe and sustainable manner.”
He explained that this collaboration reflects banks’ confidence in the soundness of consumer finance portfolios and the robustness of the sector’s risk-management practices. At the same time, it underscores the expanding role of consumer finance in supporting the real economy by stimulating demand and strengthening household purchasing power.
Osama added that preparations are underway for the adoption of Basel III–based capital adequacy requirements, describing the move as a strategic milestone for the sector. “Basel III standards are designed to enhance capital resilience and strengthen risk controls,” he said. “The pilot phase is scheduled to begin in January 2026, and companies are already aligning their systems and capital structures in anticipation.”
Technology and supervision strengthen credit quality
Osama Farid, Chief Executive Officer of Premium Card and Board Member of the Federation, said that the sector now operates within a modern, technology-driven ecosystem that has significantly enhanced decision-making and oversight.
“Advanced data analytics, integration across multiple databases, and real-time fraud-monitoring systems have transformed the way consumer finance operates,” Farid said. “These tools have improved the efficiency of credit decisions and strengthened ongoing portfolio monitoring.”
He credited the FRA with playing a central role in this progress by establishing clear supervisory standards and encouraging the use of technology to regulate cash conversion and ensure financing is used strictly for its intended purposes. According to Farid, this regulatory approach has enhanced credit quality, reinforced consumer protection, and increased the sector’s attractiveness to both local and international investors.
Addressing the issue of cash conversion, Farid noted that it has become a key supervisory priority. Financing is now directly linked to approved suppliers and service providers, limiting misuse of funds. In parallel, unified anti-fraud systems and enhanced data sharing allow for early detection of abnormal patterns, preserving the integrity of the activity.
Financing essential needs, not luxuries
Ali Abdel Wahab, Executive Director of Consumer Finance at B.TECH and a Board Member of the Federation, said that market data confirms the responsible behavior of Egyptian consumers.
“Experience shows that consumer finance in Egypt is primarily used to meet essential needs,” Abdel Wahab said. “The bulk of financing goes toward food, healthcare, education, and basic living expenses—areas that directly shape everyday family life.”
He stressed that this usage pattern dispels concerns about excessive or speculative borrowing and confirms the sector’s role in helping households manage obligations while maintaining a reasonable standard of living. Abdel Wahab also highlighted the sector’s contribution to formal financial inclusion, noting that millions of consumers now have an established credit history for the first time.
“This development strengthens consumer protection, supports a more mature financial culture, and expands access to safe, regulated financing,” he said.
Looking ahead to 2026
The EFCF said that 2026 will represent the next phase in the evolution of Egypt’s consumer finance sector. Key priorities include further expansion of digital services, the entry of new fintech-driven players, and the launch of the Basel III pilot phase to reinforce long-term stability.
The Federation also announced plans to roll out new awareness and education initiatives aimed at improving consumer credit literacy, advancing data and analytics capabilities, and enhancing companies’ ability to reach customers in governorates beyond major urban centers.
“With strong regulation, disciplined growth, and a clear strategic vision, consumer finance is well positioned to continue supporting Egyptian households and contributing to sustainable economic development,” the Federation concluded.",1212,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9493180513381958,2025-12-21T09:23:36.555368
2025-12-20,Egypt’s urban inflation eases to 12.3% in November as food price pressures subside: CBE,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/20/egypts-urban-inflation-eases-to-12-3-in-november-as-food-price-pressures-subside-cbe/,"Annual urban headline inflation in Egypt eased slightly to 12.3% in November 2025, down from 12.5% in October, according to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). The moderation was mainly driven by a slowdown in food price inflation, which declined to 0.7% in November from 1.5% a month earlier. Non-food inflation also edged down marginally, registering 20.2% in November compared with 20.4% in October.
Annual core inflation, however, increased to 12.5% in November from 12.1% in October. On a monthly basis, core inflation decelerated sharply to 0.8% from 2.0% in October, although it remained higher than the 0.4% recorded in November 2024. This slowdown was largely attributed to a decline in core food prices, which fell by 0.8% during the month.
Monthly urban headline inflation dropped significantly to 0.3% in November, compared with 1.8% in October and 0.5% in November 2024. The monthly decline reflected broad-based decreases in both volatile and core food prices, which more than offset increases in service, retail, and regulated item prices.
At the national level, annual rural headline inflation remained broadly stable at 7.9% in November, up slightly from 7.8% in October, while nationwide headline inflation held steady at 10.0%, easing marginally from 10.1% in the previous month.
Food prices were the main driver of the monthly decline in inflation. Monthly food inflation contracted by 2.6% in November, contributing negative 1.0 percentage point to headline inflation. This was largely due to a sharp drop in volatile food prices, which declined by 11.7%, driven by a 1.8% decrease in fresh fruit prices and a pronounced 17.8% fall in vegetable prices. These declines were broadly in line with seasonal patterns, though more pronounced than usual. Poultry prices fell by 3.2%, while egg prices declined by 5.7%, reversing the increase recorded in October and further easing food inflation pressures.
In contrast, monthly non-food inflation rose by 2.1% in November, contributing 1.3 percentage points to headline inflation. This increase was primarily driven by higher regulated prices, which rose by 2.3% following the fuel price hike of 11.6% implemented on October 17 and the subsequent 13.7% increase in public inland transportation fares. Additional upward pressures came from a 7.8% rise in LPG prices and a fifth consecutive monthly increase in tobacco prices, which rose by 0.6%.
Prices of services also increased by 2.2% during the month, reflecting higher rents, private inland transportation costs, and increased spending at restaurants and cafés. Retail prices rose by 1.3%, driven by higher prices for clothing and footwear, household cleaning products, and personal care items.
Monthly core inflation stood at 0.8% in November, reflecting the combined impact of these developments. Core food prices contributed negatively to core inflation, while services and retail items continued to exert upward pressure.",453,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.959350883960724,2025-12-21T09:25:00.105469

During the meeting, El-Khatib emphasized Egypt’s commitment to localizing energy-related industries, transferring advanced technologies, and creating new employment opportunities in the sector. He highlighted the country’s strong capabilities and competitive advantages, which position Egypt to become a regional energy hub.
“Egypt aims to enhance the utilization of sustainable energy resources, with a particular focus on solar energy,” El-Khatib said. “We are also committed to attracting investments through investor-friendly policies, and the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade is fully prepared to provide all necessary facilitation and support to prospective partners.”
The Minister noted that Egypt has invested $550bn in recent years to upgrade infrastructure and implement comprehensive economic reforms, including amendments to fiscal, monetary, and trade policies. He added that these measures have significantly improved the country’s economic indicators.
El-Khatib also highlighted the Ministry’s digital transformation initiatives, including the launch of a unified digital platform consolidating all investment and trade procedures. “This platform helps eliminate bureaucracy, enhances the investment climate, and boosts competitiveness in line with the state’s economic objectives,” he said. He further stressed that Egypt’s economic strategy prioritizes a leading role for the private sector, while the state focuses on coordination and facilitation.
Shihab Kuran expressed Power Edison’s strong interest in entering the Egyptian market, including conducting a feasibility study for local manufacturing.

2025-12-21,Remittances from Egyptians abroad hit $33.9bn in 10M of 2025: CBE,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/21/remittances-from-egyptians-abroad-hit-33-9bn-in-10m-of-2025-cbe/,"Remittances from Egyptians working abroad recorded unprecedented inflows during the first 10 months of 2025, reaching approximately $33.9bn, compared with around $23.7bn in the same period of the previous year, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) announced on Sunday.
On a monthly basis, remittances rose by 26.2% year-on-year in October, reaching about $3.7bn, up from nearly $2.9bn in October 2024, according to the CBE.
Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly has repeatedly affirmed the state’s appreciation of the vital national role played by Egyptians abroad, noting that expatriates have demonstrated a strong sense of belonging and patriotism through the continued rise in remittance inflows. He stressed that remittances represent one of Egypt’s most important sources of foreign currency, particularly amid the economic pressures resulting from regional and global crises.
Madbouly attributed this performance to monetary and economic reform measures undertaken by the Central Bank in coordination with the government, including the adoption of a flexible exchange-rate regime and the government’s continued commitment to its broader economic reform programme.
For its part, the Cabinet’s Media Centre said in a report that the record growth in remittances reflects the prudent monetary policy pursued by the CBE. This approach has helped stabilise the exchange rate, strengthen confidence in the economy, and bolster net international reserves, enhancing the state’s capacity to confront external shocks.
The Media Centre also highlighted the long-term upward trajectory of remittances, noting that inflows have more than doubled over the past decade, reaching $36.5bn in fiscal year 2024/2025, compared with $17.1bn in 2015. It added that the International Monetary Fund has confirmed that the recent surge in remittances reflects growing confidence in the economic reforms implemented since March 2024.
Meanwhile, prominent banking expert Mohamed Abdel Aal described remittances from Egyptians abroad as “Egypt’s inexhaustible mine,” noting that they significantly exceed the value of gold holdings within the country’s foreign exchange reserves.
Abdel Aal said that while remittances primarily support Egyptian families, they also constitute a strategic economic lifeline whose value surpasses that of traditional reserve assets. He pointed out that gold holdings in the CBE’s reserves amount to roughly $16.5bn, whereas annual remittance inflows currently exceed $34bn.
He explained that gold is a fixed reserve asset whose value fluctuates with global prices, whereas remittances represent a renewable, recurring flow that is replenished annually. Unlike foreign direct investment or external borrowing, these inflows are generated by Egyptian human capital abroad and do not create future financial obligations.
According to Abdel Aal, remittances are driven by social and economic motivations, making them more resilient and flexible than other sources of foreign currency that are often vulnerable to geopolitical tensions or global market volatility. He added that while gold serves as a reserve asset in times of crisis, it is not readily liquid for daily economic needs. Remittances, by contrast, enter the economy as immediately usable foreign currency, supporting imports, meeting external obligations, and reinforcing reserves.
Abdel Aal noted that remittances declined in 2022/2023 due to the expansion of the parallel currency market. However, following the liberalisation of the exchange rate in March 2024 and subsequent reforms, inflows surged and returned to official channels.
He said that remittances rose by 84.4% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the same period a year earlier, reaching $30.2bn in the first months of the year alone. Drivers of this growth include exchange-rate unification, government incentives such as the duty-free car import initiative, high-yield savings instruments, and social factors such as expatriates’ support for their families and their attachment to Egypt.
To sustain these inflows, Abdel Aal called for deeper integration of expatriates into the domestic economy through dollar-denominated investment funds, entrepreneurship programmes, health insurance and pension schemes, as well as targeted tax and customs incentives.
He concluded that remittances from Egyptians abroad are not merely balance-of-payments figures, but a strategic national asset whose annual value and reliability surpass those of even the most precious metals held in the country’s vaults.",654,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.958747923374176,2025-12-22T09:31:48.332543

Saied Embaby, CEO of iSagha, said local gold prices increased by roughly EGP 45 over the week. The price of 21-karat gold opened trading at EGP 5,745 per gram, touched EGP 5,800, and closed at EGP 5,790. Meanwhile, global gold rose by approximately $40 per ounce, from $4,299 at the start of the week to $4,339 at the close.
Embaby added that 24-karat gold reached EGP 6,617 per gram, 18-karat gold stood at EGP 4,963, and the price of a gold pound climbed to EGP 46,320.
Since the beginning of 2025, local gold prices have surged by around EGP 2,050, marking a 55% increase. Globally, gold has risen by about $1,715 per ounce, or 65%, delivering its strongest annual performance since 1979.
The gains have been driven by sustained central bank purchases, rising inflationary pressures, and expectations of interest rate cuts. Last week, spot gold prices approached record levels, reaching $4,374 per ounce on Thursday, close to this year’s peak of $4,381, despite rising global bond yields.
Economic data suggesting weaker US consumer confidence and slightly lower inflation expectations supported gold’s momentum. The University of Michigan reported that the US consumer sentiment index fell to 52.9 in December from 53.3, below market expectations of 53.5. Respondents anticipated higher unemployment and continued declines in durable goods purchases, while one-year inflation expectations rose to 4.2% and five-year expectations held steady at 3.2%.
Meanwhile, US Treasury yields increased after the Bank of Japan raised its interest rate from 0.50% to 0.75%, pushing the 10-year US Treasury yield up by 2.5 basis points to 4.147%. Despite this typically negative correlation with gold, prices continued to rise, supported by strong demand.
John Williams, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, noted that recent data indicate further moderation in inflation and emphasized that there is currently no urgent need to adjust monetary policy. Markets are pricing in cumulative rate cuts of around 60 basis points by the Fed over 2026, with the first expected in June. Traders also assign a roughly 20% probability of a rate cut at the January 28 meeting.
Goldman Sachs forecasts that gold could rise by 14% to $4,900 per ounce by December 2026, citing potential upside risks if retail investors continue diversifying their portfolios.

Speaking at a meeting of the Council of the Union of Arab Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, Kouchouk said that the government’s tax and customs facilitation initiatives are designed to build trust and foster partnership with the business community, while delivering rapid and tangible results on the ground.
The Minister stressed that the Egyptian and Arab private sector has the capacity to drive a major leap in regional economies, adding that the government’s role is to provide maximum support to unlock this potential.
Kouchouk said Egypt is working to position itself as a regional hub for manufacturing and exports to Africa, Europe and Asia, within the framework of broader economic policies aimed at enhancing competitiveness and attracting foreign direct investment.
He noted that Egypt’s fiscal and economic priorities place greater emphasis on the private sector’s role in investing for the future, in a way that serves both economic growth and citizens’ interests. He added that intra-regional investments have increased significantly, while considerable opportunities remain for deeper trade integration.
The Minister also highlighted improvements in the banking sector’s net foreign assets and growth in foreign exchange reserves, reflecting increased financial stability.
On public finances, Kouchouk said the debt ratio of budgetary entities to GDP declined from 96% to 86% over the past two years, with further reductions targeted this year. He added that Egypt has reduced the external debt of budgetary entities by around $2 billion, underscoring that the country is “repaying more than it is borrowing.”
Kouchouk pointed to strong investment momentum in the economic zones, which have attracted a wide range of companies focused on production and export. He noted that the 73% increase in private investment during the last fiscal year demonstrates the private sector’s ability to lead Egypt’s economic growth.

2025-12-22,Egypt’s digital exports reach $7.4bn over seven years: Communications Minister,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/22/egypts-digital-exports-reach-7-4bn-over-seven-years-communications-minister/,"Egypt’s digital exports reached $7.4bn over the past seven years, marking a 124% increase from $3.3bn in 2018, Minister of Communications and Information Technology Amr Talaat said, noting the sustained expansion of the communications and information technology (ICT) sector.
Speaking at the monthly meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, Talaat said the ICT sector has remained the fastest-growing in the economy over the past seven years, recording annual growth rates of between 14% and 16%. He added that the sector’s contribution to gross domestic product rose from 3.2% to 6% during the current year.
The Minister said outsourcing exports doubled over the past three years, increasing from $2.4bn in 2022 to $4.8bn in 2025. He added that the number of companies operating in Egypt’s outsourcing industry increased from 90 to 240, with more than 270 service delivery centres currently in operation nationwide.
Talaat reviewed the vision and key pillars of Egypt’s Digital Strategy, which is built on four main pillars: fostering digital innovation, enhancing digital services for citizens, driving GDP growth and exports, and creating jobs in the digital economy. These pillars are underpinned by two core foundations—robust digital infrastructure and a supportive legislative environment.
He stressed the Ministry’s commitment to expanding the pool of qualified ICT professionals to support digital transformation projects, noting that workforce development is a major factor in attracting global companies to establish service centres in Egypt. He said the number of trainees in technological specialisations increased 200-fold over seven years, rising from 4,000 in fiscal year 2018/2019 to 500,000 in the last fiscal year, with a target of training 800,000 individuals in the current fiscal year.
Talaat said the digital capacity-building strategy is based on two main tracks—formal education and vocational training—aimed at aligning education and training programmes with labour market needs. He highlighted the graduation of the first cohort from Egypt University of Informatics in the New Administrative Capital, as well as the expansion of WE Schools of Applied Technology from a single school in 2021 to 27 schools across all governorates.
He also noted the diversification of training delivery methods, including in-person training, online learning via digital platforms, and blended learning models. Talaat pointed to the MaharaTech platform, which offers specialised digital training content across a wide range of technological fields.
The Minister said the Ministry focuses on building a comprehensive skills framework for trainees that includes technical, language, and soft skills, as well as freelance and entrepreneurship capabilities. He added that programmes have been launched to prepare young people for the freelance economy and to support non-ICT professionals in developing AI-related skills. He also referred to the Digitopia competition, which aims to identify talent in digital creativity.
Talaat noted that Egypt launched its National Artificial Intelligence Strategy in 2019, contributing to the country’s advancement by 46 places in the Government AI Readiness Index. He added that the second edition of the strategy, launched earlier this year, is built around six pillars: data, skills, ecosystem, infrastructure, applications, and governance. He highlighted ongoing efforts to deploy AI-based systems to improve service delivery, including an early breast cancer detection system and a speech-to-text system used in court sessions.
The Minister also reviewed achievements supporting Egypt’s position as a global outsourcing destination. He said agreements signed in November last year with 55 global and local companies will generate around 75,000 new jobs over the next three years. This follows agreements signed with 29 companies in 2022 to expand or establish outsourcing centres, which initially targeted 34,000 jobs and resulted in 60,000 jobs implemented by the end of 2024.
Talaat said 15 global and local brands are currently manufacturing mobile phones in Egypt, with a local value-added component of around 40%. He added that production capacity increased from 3.3 million units in 2024 to 10 million units in 2025.
He also highlighted progress in digital government services, noting that the Egypt Digital Services Platform now offers 210 government services, serves more than 10 million users, and processes around 2 million transactions each month.
On infrastructure, Talaat said investments of $6bn have been made since 2019 to upgrade fixed and mobile internet networks, including $2.7bn for mobile services and $3.3bn for fixed broadband. This has driven a nearly 16-fold increase in average internet speed to 91.3 Mbps, placing Egypt first globally in average fixed broadband speed, compared with 40th place in 2018.
He added that the second phase of the network development programme includes expanding fibre-optic deployment nationwide, connecting around 4,500 villages under the “Decent Life” initiative, and rolling out 5G, Wi-Fi Calling, Internet of Things services for vehicles, and a telemarketing governance system. He noted that more than 90% of data traffic between Asia and Europe passes through Egypt via 21 international submarine cables, including six currently under construction.
Talaat concluded by highlighting the legislative and regulatory framework governing the sector, including the Cybercrime Law, the Personal Data Protection Law, the Egyptian Responsible AI Charter, the Cloud First Policy, and the Open Data Policy.",830,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9420052766799928,2025-12-23T09:30:15.154383

During the discussions, Rahmy reviewed the participants’ projects and listened to the main challenges they encounter, particularly those related to marketing, patent activation, expansion into global markets, export opportunities, supply chain development, networking with government institutions supporting entrepreneurship, access to financing mechanisms, and the establishment of small-scale factories as an alternative to fragmented outsourcing arrangements.
He stressed that MSMEDA’s doors remain open to all citizens and young innovators, in line with the directives of Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, Chairperson of MSMEDA’s Board of Directors, which place the support of innovative entrepreneurship among the Agency’s top priorities.

Penalties for commercial transport violations have also been increased, combining higher fines with potential jail sentences.

2025-12-24,Strong expectations of interest-rate cut at CBE’s year-end meeting,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/24/strong-expectations-of-interest-rate-cut-at-cbes-year-end-meeting/,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) is set to hold its final meeting of 2025 on Thursday, amid strong market expectations that it will cut key policy interest rates.
The MPC will decide on the fate of the CBE’s benchmark rates, which guide short-term interest-rate movements on the Egyptian pound. At its previous meeting on 20 November, the Committee opted to keep rates unchanged at 21% for deposits, 22% for lending, and 21.5% for both the credit and discount rate and the main operation rate. This decision followed cumulative cuts of around 6.25% earlier in the year, implemented in four stages: 2.25% in April, 1% in May, 2% in August, and 1% in October.
Inflation developments
Explaining its November decision, the MPC said it was based on its assessment of inflation developments and the outlook since the previous meeting in October.
The Committee noted that inflation expectations remain exposed to upside risks, both globally and domestically. These include the potential escalation of geopolitical tensions, the relative persistence of services inflation, and fiscal consolidation measures exceeding expectations. It stressed that such risks require close monitoring of inflation trends and their implications over the forecast horizon, warranting a cautious approach to monetary easing.
The MPC added that it had adopted a wait-and-see approach by keeping policy rates unchanged, considering this stance appropriate for containing inflationary pressures, anchoring expectations, and reinforcing the downward trajectory of inflation.
The Committee reiterated that monetary policy decisions will continue to be assessed on a meeting-by-meeting basis, depending on the evolving outlook, associated risks, and incoming data. It reaffirmed its commitment to achieving price stability by steering inflation towards its target of 7% (± 2%) on average in the fourth quarter of 2026, stressing that it would not hesitate to use all available tools to meet this objective.
Earlier this month, the CBE reported that core inflation rose to 12.5% in November 2025, up from 12.1% in October, while the monthly core consumer price index increased by 0.8%, compared with 2% a month earlier.
Meanwhile, the monthly change in the headline consumer price index for urban areas, as reported by the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics, stood at 0.3% in November, down from 1.8% in October. Annual headline inflation in urban areas eased to 12.3% from 12.5%.
Expectations of investment banks and experts
A number of investment banks–including EFG Hermes, Al-Naeem, Al-Ahly Pharos, Mubasher Financial, Cairo Capital, Arabia Online and Thndr–have forecast an interest-rate cut of between 50 and 100 basis points at Thursday’s meeting.
A Reuters poll of 14 economists also showed expectations that the CBE would cut its key policy rates by 100 basis points, citing the slight slowdown in inflation in November.
Prominent banking expert Mohamed Abdel Aal expects the MPC to prioritise economic growth and resume the easing cycle by cutting interest rates by between 100 and 200 basis points at its final meeting of the year.
Abdel Aal said several factors underpin this view, foremost among them the CBE’s target of bringing average inflation down to 7% (± 2%) by the end of 2026. Achieving this, he argued, would require the nominal policy rate to fall to around 13-15%. With the current average policy rate standing at about 21.25%, the MPC would need to cut rates by 600-800 basis points over the medium term, justifying a faster pace of easing starting from the upcoming meeting.
He added that the US Federal Reserve’s ongoing rate cuts help preserve an attractive interest-rate differential between the Egyptian pound and the US dollar, even if Egypt eases policy. This, he said, gives the CBE sufficient room to lower rates and stimulate growth without risking a sharp decline in foreign portfolio inflows.
Mohamed Abdel Aal
Real interest rate
According to Abdel Aal, Egypt’s real interest rate remains high at around 8.75%, a contractionary level that constrains growth. Reducing rates would help lower borrowing costs for businesses and households, encourage investment and spending, and support economic expansion at a time of relative inflation stability.
He also highlighted the fiscal impact, noting that every 1% cut in interest rates reduces government debt-servicing costs by around EGP 70bn, easing pressure on the state budget.
Abdel Aal further pointed to the relative stability–and recent strength–of the Egyptian pound against the US dollar, which lowers the cost of imported inputs and finished goods. This “imported inflation mitigation”, he said, gives producers room to absorb cost increases rather than passing them fully on to consumers.
He added that while rate cuts do not yield immediate effects, they gradually reduce financing costs, allowing companies either to cut prices to enhance competitiveness or absorb higher energy costs, thereby supporting growth through lower credit burdens.
Taken together, Abdel Aal concluded, the objectives of supporting growth, avoiding economic stagnation, and easing the public debt burden tilt the balance in favour of a 200-basis-point rate cut at Thursday’s MPC meeting.
Egypt’s external position
Meanwhile, HC Securities and Investment expects the CBE to cut interest rates by 150 basis points.
Heba Mounir, the firm’s macroeconomic analyst, said Egypt’s external position has shown resilience, with net international reserves rising by 0.29% month-on-month and by around 7% since the start of the year to a record $50.2bn in November.
She noted that net foreign assets in the banking sector increased by around 9% month-on-month to $22.7bn in October, while remittances from Egyptians abroad rose by 26% year-on-year to $3.7bn. In addition, Egypt’s one-year credit default swap spread fell sharply to 138 basis points, and Suez Canal revenues increased by about 17% year-on-year during the first five months of the current fiscal year.
“These factors contributed to a roughly 7% appreciation of the Egyptian pound against the dollar since the beginning of the year,” Mounir said.
On the domestic front, she added, the Purchasing Managers’ Index reached 51.1 points in November–its highest level since October 2020–supported by stronger demand and easing cost pressures.
HC expects inflation to continue its gradual decline due to base effects and believes current Treasury bill yields remain attractive for foreign investors, offering a real return of about 10.5% after tax, based on a forecast of 11% average inflation over the next 12 months.
The firm added that the decline in Egypt’s CDS spread is likely to contribute to further reductions in the yields demanded by investors.
“Based on improvements in Egypt’s external position, the exchange rate, and easing inflation, we expect the MPC to cut interest rates by 150 basis points at its 25 December meeting to stimulate private-sector growth,” HC said.
Heba Mounir
Egyptian monetary policy management
Banking expert Shaimaa Wagih also expects an interest-rate cut at the CBE’s final meeting of 2025, describing the decision as a strategic turning point in Egypt’s monetary policy management.
She said the move would reflect a balanced approach that supports economic activity while safeguarding financial-market stability, noting improvements in inflation indicators and liquidity conditions.
“A rate cut reflects a clear and well-calibrated economic vision,” Wagih said, citing lower borrowing costs, stronger investment, enhanced purchasing power, improved liquidity, and stronger aggregate demand as key benefits.
Shaimaa Wagih
She added that such a decision would positively affect the banking sector and capital markets by lowering financing costs, encouraging productive investment, and supporting banks’ ability to diversify loan portfolios and improve returns.
According to Wagih, the expected move underscores the CBE’s precise and balanced monetary management, taking into account inflation control, exchange-rate stability and liquidity conditions in a way that strengthens the resilience of the financial system.
She concluded that a rate cut at Thursday’s meeting would represent a carefully calculated step aimed at stimulating growth and domestic investment while preserving monetary and financial stability, reinforcing confidence in Egypt’s economic management.",1286,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.514254629611969,2025-12-25T09:27:33.509909

The total reflects a 54.6% growth in financing granted between January and October 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Since Mohamed Farid assumed the chairmanship of the FRA in August 2022, financing activities have grown by 82.5%, rising from EGP 584bn at the end of 2022 to the current EGP 1.1trn.
The FRA’s data provided a breakdown of the financing distributed during the ten-month period:
Equity issuances:
EGP 553.4bn, representing growth of 41.6%.
Financial leasing contracts:
EGP 139.9bn, with a growth rate of 58.2%.
Factoring activity:
EGP 102bn, an 82.4% increase.
SME and micro-enterprise financing:
EGP 85.9bn, up 11.9%.
Securities issuances (excluding shares):
EGP 77.2bn, a 145.8% increase.
Consumer finance:
EGP 74.9bn, rising by 58%.
Mortgage finance:
EGP 32.5bn, a 55.5% growth.
Movable collateral also saw significant growth during the January–October 2025 period, with the value of registered assets in the registry reaching EGP 4trn, a 39.8% increase year-on-year. Furthermore, financing balances for small, medium, and micro-enterprises (SMEs) rose to EGP 93.8bn by the end of October 2025, a 27.1% increase compared to the same period in 2024. The FRA stated these indicators reflect the resilience and sustainability of non-banking financial growth, and the role of the regulatory and legislative framework in supporting credit flow, financial inclusion, and economic activity.
In a separate development, the FRA completed an update of its Responsible Pricing Reference Index for SME and micro-project financing products, based on September 2025 prices. The index, launched by Farid in September 2023, is the first of its kind in Egypt’s financial sector.
The latest statistical data for the index revealed that non-bank financing costs in Egypt remained relatively stable between September 2024 and September 2025, with limited price movements across most financing categories despite current economic variables. The update is intended to allow consumers to compare costs and support rational financing decisions through increased transparency.
“The periodic review of the Responsible Pricing Index for micro, small, and medium enterprise products showed important results in September 2025,” Farid said. He added that the data reflected the flexibility of licensed entities in managing costs and their ability to absorb market changes while directing financing toward low- and medium-risk customers.
According to the index, individual micro-project financing prices moved within stable ranges during September 2025. Median pricing levels (Median) ranged from approximately 30% for low-risk customers to 32% for high-risk customers. Minimum pricing levels remained stable across all risk categories, while market trends showed a concentration of financing entities dealing with medium-risk clients.
Group micro-project financing also showed price stability, with median rates ranging between 31.5% for low-risk customers and 33% for high-risk customers. For SME projects, the index showed a positive stability compared to other products, with the median price range limited to between 22.4% and 22.7% across various risk categories. Minimum pricing (Minimum) for SMEs remained between 19.5% and 20.6%.
The FRA reported that 81% of SME financing entities adhered to the responsible pricing standards according to the index. Meanwhile, commitment rates stood at 64.4% for individual financing entities and 64.3% for group financing entities.",543,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8889300227165222,2025-12-25T09:27:43.336095

Khaled Abdel Ghaffar, Deputy Prime Minister for Human Development and Minister of Health and Population, provided an overview of Giza’s health landscape, noting that the governorate serves 9,564,743 people.
According to Abdel Ghaffar, Giza contains 190 hospitals—31 government and 159 private—alongside 239 primary care facilities, which include 22 health departments, 196 health offices, and 212 health units. He detailed the capacity of the sector, stating that the government provides 2,735 inpatient beds and 537 intensive care beds, while the private sector contributes 4,957 inpatient and 1,343 intensive care beds.
In terms of medical equipment, the government sector operates 729 dialysis machines and 357 incubators, compared to 289 machines and 659 incubators in private facilities. Additionally, 654 ventilators are available in the government sector and 678 in the private sector. The health minister noted that the ministry’s facilities employ 4,050 doctors, 2,851 dentists, 4,314 pharmacists, and 6,657 nurses, while private hospitals employ 6,109 doctors, 211 dentists, 507 pharmacists, and 5,994 nurses.

Polyester and Polymer Complex
Tyre Manufacturing Facility
Health Products and Nonwoven Fabrics
The total investment attracted in the last six months has already surpassed the $4.6bn recorded during the entire FY2024/25, SCZONE Chairperson Walid Gamal El-Dien said on Tuesday. The new agreements, signed at the government headquarters in the New Capital, are expected to create 5,400 direct jobs.
Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, who witnessed the signing, said the projects reflect “growing confidence from major international companies in Egypt’s investment climate.” He added that the SCZONE’s infrastructure and logistical integration between industrial areas and ports support the state’s strategy to deepen local manufacturing, increase exports, and provide employment.
The contracts were signed between Teda-Egypt and three Chinese firms for projects within the Sokhna Industrial Zone.
Polyester and Polymer Complex
The largest of the three agreements involves the Xin Feng Ming Group, which will establish an integrated industrial complex for polyester fibres and polymers with investments exceeding $800m.
Spanning 400,000 square metres, the project will be implemented in three phases with a total annual production capacity of 1.08 million tonnes, creating 3,000 jobs.
Phase one of the project, including the construction, is scheduled to begin in May 2026, with operations starting in the fourth quarter of 2027.
While phase two is set to begin in 2028 and become operational in 2029, phase three implementation starts in 2029 with operations commencing in 2030.
The first two phases include production lines for POY and DTY polyester yarn with an annual capacity exceeding 360,000 tonnes and expected annual sales of $455m. The third phase aims to complete industrial integration to bridge the gap in raw materials for the Egyptian textile industry, particularly in upstream manufacturing, while directing 50% of production toward regional and international export markets.
Tyre Manufacturing Facility
A second contract was signed with Chaoyang Langma Tyre to build a complex for heavy truck and passenger car tyres. The project involves an expected investment of $190m on a 200,000 square metre site, providing 1,400 jobs.
The project will be executed in two main stages, the first starting in April 2026, focusing on basic construction and a heavy truck tyre (TBR) production line.
The second phase, starting in September 2028 for 12 months, will include expansions to the TBR line and the establishment of a passenger car tyre (PCR) line.
Targeted annual capacities are 1 million heavy truck tyres and 4.5 million passenger car tyres.
Health Products and Nonwoven Fabrics
The third agreement with Tongling Jieya Biotechnology involves a $160m industrial complex for health products. Located on 160,000 square metres, the facility will create 1,000 jobs.
The company aims for an annual production capacity of 10 billion wet wipes, 2 billion baby diapers, and 100,000 tonnes of nonwoven fabrics using water-jet and hot-air technologies. The project is expected to generate $270m in annual revenue at full operation.
Gamal El-Dien stated that these investments represent the targeted industrial diversity for the SCZONE, spanning textile inputs, heavy industries, and advanced health products. He noted that the surge in investment to $5.1bn in record time demonstrates the success of the partnership with Teda-Egypt and the zone’s readiness to host large-scale projects.",557,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8174411654472351,2025-12-25T09:28:14.828144
2025-12-27,1% interest-rate cut appropriate to sustain disinflation path: CBE,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/27/1-interest-rate-cut-appropriate-to-sustain-disinflation-path-cbe/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) said a 1% cut in interest rates is appropriate to maintain a monetary policy stance that anchors inflation expectations and supports the continued downward trajectory of inflation.
On Thursday evening, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the Bank’s key policy rates—which serve as the main benchmark for short-term interest-rate movements on the Egyptian pound—by 1%, bringing them to 20% for overnight deposits, 21% for overnight lending, and 20.5% for both the main operation rate and the credit and discount rate.
The MPC said the decision reflects its assessment of inflation developments and the inflation outlook since its previous meeting on 20 November.
At the global level, the Committee noted that economic growth has continued its relative recovery, although the outlook remains clouded by uncertainty surrounding trade policies, ongoing geopolitical tensions and slower growth in global demand.
Inflation dynamics globally have remained broadly stable, with central banks in both advanced and emerging economies continuing to adopt a cautious approach to monetary easing through gradual policy adjustments.
In global commodity markets, oil prices declined as global supply outpaced demand, while agricultural commodity prices recorded mixed movements. Nevertheless, the Committee warned that risks remain elevated, particularly given the potential for supply-chain disruptions and escalating geopolitical tensions.
Domestically, the MPC said the CBE’s estimates point to real GDP growth of around 5% in the fourth quarter of 2025, compared with 5.3% in the third quarter. Growth in Q3 was mainly driven by positive contributions from non-oil manufacturing, trade and communications sectors.
Despite the continuation of economic growth, the Committee said the current output path is expected to support the anticipated short-term decline in inflation, as demand-side inflationary pressures are likely to remain contained under the prevailing monetary policy stance.
On inflation developments, the MPC noted that annual headline inflation resumed its downward trend, reaching 12.3% in November 2025, despite the recent increase in fuel prices.
This decline was largely driven by a sharp fall in annual food inflation, which dropped to 0.7%, its lowest level in more than four years. Annual core inflation, meanwhile, stood at 12.5%, reflecting higher prices of non-food items, particularly services.
On a monthly basis, headline and core inflation recorded 0.3% and 0.8%, respectively, in November. The moderation in recent monthly inflation readings compared with typical seasonal patterns indicates an improvement in inflation expectations and the gradual fading of the effects of previous shocks, the Committee said.
Looking ahead, the CBE’s forecasts indicate that annual headline inflation will stabilise near its current levels in the fourth quarter of 2025, averaging around 14% for the year as a whole, compared with 28.3% in 2024.
In 2026, inflation is expected to decline further and approach the Bank’s target by the fourth quarter of the year. However, the pace of disinflation remains constrained by the slow easing of non-food inflation and the impact of fiscal consolidation measures, while global geopolitical tensions continue to pose upside risks to inflation expectations.
The MPC reaffirmed that it will continue to assess its decisions regarding the pace of monetary easing based on the inflation outlook, surrounding risks and incoming data. It said it will closely monitor economic and financial developments and will not hesitate to use all available tools to achieve price stability by steering inflation towards its target of 7% (±2%) on average in the fourth quarter of 2026.",561,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.8220447897911072,2025-12-28T09:23:43.004468

The portfolio represents a 2.8% share of total mortgage financing directed to low- and middle-income housing, serving 33,890 beneficiaries nationwide.
Data issued by the Fund highlight United Bank’s growing role in supporting the real estate sector and expanding access to affordable housing for low- and middle-income citizens across Egypt.
Tarek Fayad, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of United Bank, said that expanding mortgage finance for low- and middle-income housing is one of the State’s and the Central Bank of Egypt’s key mechanisms for achieving social justice, eliminating informal settlements, enhancing financial inclusion and empowering vulnerable groups.
He explained that this is achieved by stimulating the housing market to provide subsidised units across governorates—particularly in Upper Egypt and new urban communities—contributing to higher economic growth and the achievement of sustainable development.
Fayad added that mortgage finance solutions represent a core focus of the Bank’s strategy. United Bank currently operates across 16 governorates and 12 new cities nationwide, continuously enhancing service quality in terms of speed and efficiency through the adoption of digital transformation tools.
The Bank delivers mortgage finance services through 68 branches across the country and, in recent years, has launched a range of advanced, digitally supported financing solutions to improve customer experience and accelerate access to finance. These include digital wallets, mobile banking and internet banking services, which facilitate transactions, save time and effort, and help clients meet their payment obligations on schedule.
United Bank provides mortgage finance services in nine Upper Egypt governorates—Giza, Fayoum, Beni Suef, Minya, Assiut, Sohag, Qena, Luxor and Aswan—as well as four governorates in the Canal region: Port Said, Suez, Ismailia and the Red Sea.
In addition, the Bank operates in 12 new urban communities, including 6th of October City, 10th of Ramadan City, Obour, Shorouk, Badr, Borg El Arab, Nubaria, New Damietta, New Alamein City, Sheikh Zayed, Sadat City and 15 May City. It also covers seven governorates in Delta: Monufeya, Gharbia, Beheira, Kafr El-Sheikh, Sharqeya, Dakahleya and Cairo.

2025-12-27,EGP 25bn project launched to supply electricity to one million feddans in West Minya Plain,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/27/egp-25bn-project-launched-to-supply-electricity-to-one-million-feddans-in-west-minya-plain/,"The Egyptian Countryside Development Company has announced the launch of a major project to construct extra-high-voltage and high-voltage power stations and feeder lines, in coordination with the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company, an affiliate of the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy.
The move represents a new step in supporting efforts to develop and reclaim lands under the national 1.5 Million Feddan Project, contributing to sustainable development across its various sites and regions.
According to a company statement, a cooperation and consultancy contract has been signed with one of the largest specialised firms in the field of extra-high-voltage substations—the Egyptian Power Systems Engineering Company (EPS). Under the agreement, EPS will review technical designs and supervise tendering and implementation works for supplying electricity to the Egyptian Countryside Development Company’s lands in the West Minya Plain.
The electricity extension project targets approximately one million feddans of land in the West Minya Plain, at an estimated total cost of EGP 25bn. The project will be implemented in two phases. The first phase, with a capacity of 100 megavolt-amperes (MVA), will cover the areas of South-West West Minya, the western extension of Minya, and West Manfalut and Al-Qusiya. The second phase will extend to Darb Al-Behnasawy, West Minya, and North-West West Minya.
Upon completion of all phases, the project’s total capacity is expected to reach around 500 MVA, enabling electricity supply across the entire scope of the 1.5 Million Feddan Project lands in the West Minya Plain.
Amr Abdel Wahab, Chairperson and Managing Director of the Egyptian Countryside Development Company, said the cooperation represents a significant milestone in agricultural development efforts within the national project. He stressed that the provision of electricity goes beyond basic infrastructure preparation, describing it as a pivotal element in enabling modern agriculture, supporting investors and creating an integrated environment for agricultural and food production.
“We are implementing this project in cooperation with the consultancy entity and the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy, within the framework of a national partnership aimed at accelerating development and achieving food security by supporting farmers and equipping land with the necessary infrastructure,” Abdel Wahab said.
He noted that extending electricity to the West Minya Plain is part of a comprehensive infrastructure strategy that also includes road development, the establishment of communications networks and future plans for renewable energy stations.
“This project will directly improve agricultural production efficiency, encourage investors to inject capital into fully serviced lands, and create job opportunities for young people in Upper Egypt,” he added. “It also supports a more balanced distribution of development, in line with Egypt Vision 2030.”
Abdel Wahab emphasised that all phases of the project are being implemented in accordance with the highest international technical standards, under the supervision of the consultancy firm. He added that coordination between public and private entities ensures optimal results within the planned timelines and reflects a successful model of cooperation in delivering major national projects.
“What is being implemented today in the West Minya Plain represents a practical translation of Egypt Vision 2030 and a model of integrated development in a promising region,” he said, noting that the project will help generate hundreds of job opportunities, stimulate agricultural investment and establish a stable and sustainable productive community.",536,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8469271659851074,2025-12-28T09:24:37.023748
2025-12-27,"CBE’s 1% rate cut eases financing costs, boosts industry, market confidence",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/27/cbes-1-rate-cut-eases-financing-costs-boosts-industry-market-confidence/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) announced a 1% cut in its key interest rates last Thursday, marking a significant step towards easing monetary conditions and supporting economic activity amid signs of moderating inflation.
The decision was widely welcomed by lawmakers, business leaders and industry experts, who described it as a timely move to stimulate production, investment and competitiveness across key sectors of the economy.
Support for Industry and Production
Ahmed Ismail Sabra, Member of Parliament and Chairperson of the Investors Association in the Gamasa Industrial Zone, said the interest-rate cut provides direct support to the industrial sector at a critical juncture. He noted that lower borrowing costs will help manufacturers expand and modernise operations, enhance the competitiveness of Egyptian products in local, regional and international markets, and create additional job opportunities, particularly for young people.
Sabra stressed the importance of coordination between monetary and fiscal policies to achieve comprehensive economic and social development, adding that industrial zones—especially Gamasa—are well positioned to benefit from the improved financing environment.
Mohamed Adel Hosny, a member of the Industry Committee at the Egyptian Businessmen’s Association and the Federation of Egyptian Industries, said the decision reflects a clear state vision to support economic growth and reinforce industry as a primary engine of the national economy.
He explained that lower financing costs enable companies to upgrade production lines, expand capacity and increase exports, while strengthening the competitiveness of Egyptian products. Hosny also highlighted the government’s focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as a key driver of job creation and balanced development across governorates.
Relief for the Private Sector
Amr Fotouh, Chairperson of the Entrepreneurship and SMEs Committee at the Egyptian-Lebanese Business Association, described the rate cut as a major relief for the private sector, encouraging both the expansion of existing projects and the launch of new investments.
He said reduced borrowing and operating costs would support market stability and stimulate trade, production and exports. Fotouh noted that Egypt’s merchandise exports reached around $45bn in 2024 and are expected to exceed $50bn by the end of 2025, adding that easing financing burdens would further strengthen industry as a key source of foreign currency.
Ahmed El-Zayat, a member of the Egyptian Businessmen’s Association, said the return to an interest-rate cutting cycle aligns with the gradual decline in inflation and the CBE’s target of steering inflation towards 7% by the fourth quarter of 2026.
He described the move as a positive signal of economic recovery, encouraging investment over savings, lowering borrowing costs, and supporting job creation, exports and foreign investment inflows.
Impact on the Real Estate Sector
Urban planning expert Mohamed Mostafa El-Qady said cumulative interest-rate cuts exceeding 7% during 2025 have had mixed but largely positive effects on the market, particularly by providing indirect stimulus to the real estate sector.
He explained that extended payment plans offered by developers effectively represent an indirect price reduction, while the maturity of high-yield savings certificates could redirect savings towards property investments in 2026, potentially driving higher demand and prices in the second half of the year.
Abeer Essam El-Din, Chairwoman of the Arab Council for Businesswomen and a board member of the Egyptian Federation of Investor Associations, said monetary easing policies clearly support real estate development, especially for small developers. She added that declining returns on savings certificates enhance the appeal of real estate as a store of value, with expectations of stronger sales and sector growth in 2026.
Positive Tax and Trade Implications
Ramy Fathallah, Chairperson of the Tax and Finance Committee at the Egyptian-Lebanese Business Association, said the interest-rate cut reflects improving macroeconomic indicators and sends a strong signal of confidence in Egypt’s ability to balance inflation control with economic growth.
He noted that lower financing costs would ease pressure on industrial and agricultural companies, stimulate economic activity and indirectly contribute to higher and more sustainable tax revenues, while reinforcing investor confidence.
Despite welcoming the decision, Mohamed Saada, Secretary-General of the Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce and Chair of the Port Said Chamber, said interest rates remain relatively high and require further reductions to achieve a full financing breakthrough.
Saada added that the impact of the cut is expected to become more evident over the next two months, with relative price stability or slight declines, improved purchasing power and stronger economic momentum. He noted that the automotive, real estate and food industries are among the sectors likely to benefit most, alongside increased investment inflows into the local market.",742,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.3815918266773224,2025-12-28T09:24:39.829707

Speaking at a salon hosted by the Institute of National Planning, Kouchouk stated that the external debt of budget agencies has decreased by approximately $4bn during the same two-year period. He added that the state is prioritising debt reduction and is currently paying more than it borrows to improve economic indicators.
The minister detailed the impact of the government’s first package of tax facilities, noting it has encouraged voluntary compliance. According to Kouchouk, taxpayers submitted 612,000 new and amended tax returns and voluntarily disclosed additional economic activity worth EGP 1trn, resulting in EGP 78bn in additional tax payments.
Furthermore, 400,000 requests to close old tax files were received, and 127,000 taxpayers have utilised the integrated simplified tax system to date.
Kouchouk said the strategic goal is to expand the economic, productive, and tax base to benefit citizens and investors. He noted that tax revenues increased by 36% during the last year without imposing new burdens on the business community.
“The private sector is capable of transforming Egypt into a regional centre for production and exports,” Kouchouk said, noting that private investment rose by 73% last year. He highlighted strong growth in the industrial, information technology, and tourism sectors during the previous fiscal year.
The minister announced that a second package of tax incentives for committed taxpayers is being prepared, with additional packages for customs and real estate taxes expected soon to simplify procedures. He added that the new budget will feature increased allocations for health, education, and cash support programmes targeted at the most vulnerable groups.
Kouchouk stated that reducing debt service costs would provide additional resources to improve living standards and allow for higher spending on social protection and economic support. He also noted an “ambitious vision” to develop the resources of local administrations to ensure the benefits of growth reach citizens across all governorates.
Ashraf El-Araby, head of the Institute of National Planning, said the business and economic community welcomed the current path of incentives and facilitation. He emphasised the need to accelerate progress toward the Egypt Vision 2030 targets and reduce economic gaps in the coming years.",396,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.5145149827003479,2025-12-28T09:25:58.168921
2025-12-27,From shield to showcase: Egypt’s military envoys briefed on 2026 economic ‘turning point’,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/27/from-shield-to-showcase-egypts-military-envoys-briefed-on-2026-economic-turning-point/,"In a room filled with the nation’s newly designated military attachés, the talk was not of ballistics or borders, but of textiles, tech hubs, and the price of global trade. Dr. Rania Al-Mashat, Egypt’s Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation, stood before the officers with a directive that extended beyond traditional diplomacy: to represent an economy that she claims has finally pivoted from “managing challenges” to a narrative of “construction and production.”
Contents
The Private Sector Pivot
Governance and the ‘Billion-Pound Ceiling’
The Human and Green Capital
Diplomacy of the Balance Sheet
The setting was symbolic. Addressing the officers as the “shield of the nation,” Al-Mashat sought to arm Egypt’s overseas representatives with a balance sheet to match their uniform. Her message was clear: the Egypt they will represent in 2026 is intended to be a far cry from the debt-burdened state of recent years, aiming instead to be a hub for private-sector-led industry and green energy.
By the third quarter of 2025, the “kernel” of this shift has become evident. Following a series of rigorous fiscal and monetary reforms initiated in March 2024, the Egyptian government is projecting 2026 as a definitive turning point. With growth expected to exceed 5% this fiscal year and an ambitious 7% target on the horizon, the administration is betting that a strict EGP 1 trillion (bn) ceiling on public investment will finally give the private sector the “breathing room” it needs to drive the national engine.
The Private Sector Pivot
Central to Al-Mashat’s briefing was the assertion that Egypt’s growth is no longer a state-funded monolith. Currently, the productive sectors—industry, tourism, and Information and Communications Technology (ICT)—are largely under private stewardship. “The economy is driven by productive, private-sector-led sectors,” Al-Mashat noted, pointing out that 98% of the tourism and industrial sectors are now privately held.
This transition is being felt on the ground. Industrial growth has begun to feed into a surge in exports, while the tourism sector is on track to welcome nearly 19 million visitors this year. Even the Suez Canal, which handles roughly 12% of global trade and remains a vital pulse-point for the economy, is showing signs of recovery. Despite the canal being hit hard by regional volatility, Al-Mashat cited ongoing peace efforts—sponsored by President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and U.S. President Donald Trump—as a catalyst for the waterway’s recent performance gains.
Governance and the ‘Billion-Pound Ceiling’
To ensure this recovery is sustainable, the Ministry has enforced a hard cap on public spending. By limiting public investment to EGP 1 trillion in the 2024/2025 fiscal year, the government has intentionally redirected bank credit toward private enterprises, particularly in the industrial sector.
This fiscal discipline is part of a broader “National Structural Reform Programme” overseen by the Ministry. The scale is vast, involving:
40 national entities
working in coordination.
430 specific measures
covering tax reform, trade, and labor markets.
Unified performance indicators
across all ministries to ensure “horizontal objectives” are met.
“Macroeconomic stability and reform are mutually reinforcing paths,” Al-Mashat told the attachés. “Reforms enhance stability, and stability enables reform.”
The Human and Green Capital
While the figures focus on finance, the strategy increasingly emphasizes the “human pillar.” For the 2025/2026 plan, 48% of public investments are earmarked for human development sectors. The Ministry maintains that a productive future is impossible without a healthy, skilled workforce at the “centre of development.”
Simultaneously, Egypt is repositioning itself as a renewable energy player to mitigate the high costs of fuel imports. Through the “NWFE” (Nexus of Water, Food and Energy) platform, the state has already mobilised approximately USD 5bn in concessional financing for green projects. The ultimate goal is ambitious: a power grid that derives 42% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030.
Diplomacy of the Balance Sheet
As these military attachés prepare for their postings, they carry with them more than 65 new cooperation protocols signed in 2025 alone. Egypt’s strategy now relies on “concessional financing”—lower-cost alternatives to market borrowing—which has secured USD 9.5bn for budget support and USD 17bn for the private sector since 2020.
The completion of the IMF’s fifth and sixth reviews acts as a final seal of approval for this roadmap. As the session concluded, Al-Mashat’s “kicker” for the officers was a reminder of their role in this economic architecture. By representing a stable, reforming Egypt, they are not just envoys of the military, but ambassadors of a 2026 turning point that seeks to translate high-level macro-stability into “tangible benefits for citizens” on the street.",750,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.7304427623748779,2025-12-28T09:26:28.463045

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the CBE decided to reduce the Bank’s key policy rates—which serve as the main benchmark for short-term interest-rate movements on the Egyptian pound—to 20% for overnight deposits, 21% for overnight lending, and 20.5% for both the main operation rate and the credit and discount rate.
In the first direct response to the decision, interest rates on variable-rate savings certificates and certain loan products linked to the CBE’s interest-rate corridor automatically declined by the same percentage as the cut approved by the central bank.
The Egyptian banking market offers a wide range of variable-rate savings certificates, most notably the National Bank of Egypt’s “Platinum” certificate and Banque Misr’s “Al-Qemma” certificate, in addition to a large number of loan products priced off the CBE’s key policy rates.
Meanwhile, market participants are closely monitoring the implications of the rate cut for returns on local debt instruments scheduled to be offered by the government this week, as well as the potential impact on foreign investors’ appetite for Egyptian treasury securities.
On Sunday, the Ministry of Finance is set to offer two Treasury bill auctions worth a combined EGP 60bn: EGP 20bn in 91-day bills and EGP 40bn in 273-day bills. On Monday, the ministry will offer two Treasury bond auctions worth EGP 37bn—EGP 14bn in two-year bonds and EGP 23bn in three-year bonds—alongside an auction of fixed-return sovereign sukuk worth EGP 5bn with a three-year maturity.",282,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.6511706113815308,2025-12-28T09:26:51.619079
2025-12-27,How Should Depositors Invest Their Money After Bank Certificates Mature?,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/27/how-should-depositors-invest-their-money-after-bank-certificates-mature/,"Successful investment is what allows you to sleep peacefully, knowing your money is safe, while real returns are what you actually feel in your pocket when buying your daily needs.
As 2026 approaches, many people are asking how they can preserve the value of their savings after the expiry of high-interest bank certificates.
Before searching for the highest interest rate, it is important to understand the concept of real return. There is little sense in earning 30% interest while prices are rising by 35%, as this means a real loss of 5%. It is far wiser to earn 17% while prices rise by only 12%, resulting in a real gain of 5%. In this case, the actual value of your money increases and your purchasing power improves.
Below is a ranking of investment options for savings, from the safest and most stable to the highest growth and risk:
Bank savings instruments:
Bank certificates remain the safest choice and the cornerstone of household savings. They provide a stable monthly income that helps cover living expenses, while guaranteeing full repayment of the principal at maturity with no risk.
Treasury bills:
Treasury bills rank second in terms of safety and are backed by the Ministry of Finance. They stand out for their flexibility and short maturities, with returns credited in full to your account upon purchase. They can be easily accessed through any branch of Egyptian banks.
Investment funds:
A smart option for those who do not wish to lock in their money for long periods and prefer returns that accumulate daily. These funds allow deposits and withdrawals at any time and are managed by financial professionals to reduce risk.
Stock market and equities:
Suitable for those with surplus funds they will not need in the near term. Buying shares in strong companies offers annual dividends and capital gains, but requires the ability to withstand market volatility.
Metals:
Metals are a store of value and come at the end of the list because they do not generate monthly income and are influenced by global prices. Gold remains the historic guardian of savings against inflation, while silver represents a strong buying opportunity with very promising growth expectations.
Beware of the “dollarisation” trap. Currency speculation is currently the biggest enemy of savings, as it effectively freezes money. Dollars kept at home are “dead money” that generate no return and may also expose holders to legal risks.
In conclusion: how should you allocate your savings?
A smart saver never puts all their eggs in one basket. Keep a core portion in bank certificates for monthly income, a flexible portion in Treasury bills for upfront returns and liquidity, and a future-focused portion in gold or silver to preserve value.
Always remember: successful investment is what allows you to sleep peacefully, knowing your money is safe, and real returns are what you actually feel in your pocket when buying your everyday needs.

The meeting was held within the framework of the state’s strategy to support and develop the tourism sector as a key driver of economic growth, expand hotel capacity, and strengthen partnerships with the private sector.
Discussions focused on prospects for continued cooperation and the progress of major hotel development projects that add significant value to Egypt’s tourism sector, most notably the expansion of the historic Mena House Hotel overlooking the Giza Pyramids.

In this context, Mostafa Khidr, General Manager of the Fraud Combating and Financial Crimes Centralized Department at the CBE, stated that the programme represents a strategic opportunity to enhance awareness and build a shared understanding of various fraud practices and the frameworks for combating banking fraud. He emphasized that the programme supports faster response mechanisms, the application of effective mitigation techniques, and the establishment of a clear and unified definition of banking fraud.
Khidr further stressed that fraud combating is a shared responsibility rather than an individual effort, noting that while the implementation of robust policies, procedures, and internal controls is essential, their effectiveness depends on the awareness, vigilance, and commitment of institutions, their employees, and their customers alike.

For his part, Abdel Aziz Nossier, Executive Director of the EBI, highlighted that the launch of the new training programme marks another milestone in ongoing efforts to strengthen the capabilities of banking professionals. He noted that the program—developed under the supervision of the CBE—aims to equip participants with essential knowledge and practical skills to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. Nossier also underscored that investment in human capital development is a cornerstone of building a more secure and sustainable banking sector.
The newly launched programme is designed to enhance the capacity of banking sector employees to detect and mitigate fraud risks. It targets professionals across various specializations and job levels within the banking industry. Throughout the program, participants will be introduced to different types of fraud that may affect bank employees or customers, along with effective methods to prevent such attempts. The curriculum also highlights the impact of fraud on the banking sector through real-life case studies and outlines the appropriate actions to be taken when a fraudulent incident is discovered or suspected.",358,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.694126307964325,2025-12-30T09:28:28.991475

Standing before thousands of conservative activists at the annual AmericaFest, the widow of the late Charlie Kirk made a declaration that few in the room doubted: she was ready to see her husband’s friend, Vice President JD Vance, become the 48th President of the United States.

The Loyalty Test
Building the War Chest
The MAGA Peacekeeper
The 2028 Horizon
“We are going to get my husband’s friend, JD Vance, elected as 48 in the most resounding way possible,” she told the cheering crowd. The endorsement from the CEO of Turning Point USA—who stepped into the role after the assassination of her husband in September—was more than just a gesture of friendship; it was the clearest signal yet that the starting gun for the 2028 presidential cycle has been fired from within the heart of the White House.
Quietly but methodically, Vance has begun to sketch the contours of his own political future. According to sources familiar with his thinking and reports first detailed by Axios, the Vice President is executing a sophisticated, multi-track strategy. It is a delicate choreography that requires absolute loyalty to President Donald Trump today, while simultaneously building the financial and political machinery necessary to succeed him tomorrow.
By the time the 2026 midterm elections arrive, Vance intends to have transformed his office into a powerhouse of Republican patronage, positioning himself as the undisputed heir to the MAGA (Make America Great Again) mantle without ever appearing to outshine the man at the top.
The Loyalty Test
The first and most critical pillar of the Vance plan is the maintenance of an unbreakable bond with Trump. In a movement where the President’s approval is the ultimate currency, Vance has prioritised being seen as a “loyal lieutenant.”
William Martin, the Vice President’s communications director, has been explicit about this focus. “The Vice President has been very clear since taking office in January that his primary priority is helping President Trump deliver on his campaign promises,” Martin said. This involves public defence of even the President’s most controversial policies, ensuring that Vance remains the preferred choice of a base that remains fiercely protective of Trump’s legacy.
However, being the perfect No. 2 is a hazardous role. Trump has historically been wary of subordinates who seek too much of the limelight. To navigate this, Vance’s team is reportedly focused on 2026 as a bridge, allowing him to campaign for others and build his own brand under the guise of strengthening the President’s congressional majorities.
Building the War Chest
While loyalty wins votes, capital wins campaigns. Vance’s appointment as the finance chairman for the Republican National Committee (RNC) has provided him with a unique advantage. In this role, he has been crisscrossing the country to meet with top-tier donors, effectively locking in financial support years before a primary would begin.
While he enjoys deep-rooted connections with Silicon Valley billionaires, Vance is now focused on expanding his reach to traditional GOP fundraisers. By securing these commitments early, he aims to starve potential 2028 rivals—such as Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley—of the resources needed to launch a challenge.
This financial engine is complemented by a strategy of online dominance. Rather than engaging in public spats with rivals, Vance relies on a phalanx of influential conservative voices, including Donald Trump Jr. and Jack Posobiec, to fighthis corner in the digital arena.
The MAGA Peacekeeper
Internally, the MAGA movement has been rocked by fractures over issues ranging from foreign policy to internal “purity tests.” Here, Vance has sought to position himself as a unifier. During his closing remarks at AmericaFest, he pointedly refused to participate in the “self-defeating” denunciations common in modern primary politics.
“I didn’t come with a list of names of conservatives to denounce,” Vance said, framing himself as a voice of unity against the political left rather than an arbiter of internal dogma. This approach is designed to ensure that no faction of the base feels alienated from him before the 2028 primaries even begin.
The 2028 Horizon
Current polling suggests the strategy is working. According to the Race to the White House national average, Vance holds a commanding lead among potential GOP contenders, garnering more than 45% of the vote. His nearest rivals—including Secretary of State Marco Rubio at 10.9%, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis at 9.4%, and Donald Trump Jr. at 8.6%—trail significantly.
The relationship with Rubio is particularly noteworthy. Vance has described the Secretary of State as his “best friend” within the administration, leading some, like Representative Mike Lawler, to speculate that the two could eventually form a joint ticket. “I think it’s more likely that you’ll have a Vance-Rubio ticket than anything else,” Lawler told CNN, noting that the Vice President currently has a “leg up” on the competition.
As Vance prepares to spend much of the coming year on the campaign trail for Republican candidates, he is not just fighting for a congressional majority. He is honing his rhetoric, deepening ties with local organisers, and cementing his status as the inevitable next step for the party.

2025-12-29,"Concessional financing offered to first 100,000 taxpayers joining simplified tax system",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/29/concessional-financing-offered-to-first-100000-taxpayers-joining-simplified-tax-system/,"Minister of Finance Ahmed Kouchouk said concessional financing will be provided to the first 100,000 taxpayers who join the simplified tax system, stressing that the move aims to support taxpayers, ease compliance, and help businesses expand.
Speaking during a Monday panel discussion at the Egyptian Centre for Economic Studies, Kouchouk said that sample-based audits will be applied to tax returns this year. He added that penalties will be capped at the value of the principal tax amount, and announced plans to establish three specialised tax centres through which the e-Tax system will deliver easier and more advanced services using the latest automation tools.
Kouchouk said he welcomed the professional, candid and balanced dialogue with business leaders and representatives, noting that it reflected the most pressing challenges facing the private sector. “Our economic vision is based on openness, simplification and the creation of new horizons for competition and export opportunities for all companies operating in Egypt,” he said.
He added that the government is focusing on supporting sectors and activities in which Egypt has a competitive advantage, providing them with appropriate forms of support. In this context, he said the state is targeting a larger and more impactful role for the private sector to lead economic growth, create jobs and generate sustainable additional income.
The finance minister noted that rebuilding trust with the business community depends on delivering tangible and effective improvements in tax, customs and real estate-related services. He said the government is engaging with the private sector using a new approach based on effective incentives, pointing to the strong response to the first package of tax facilitations.
Kouchouk explained that the second package of tax facilitations is being developed in line with proposals submitted by committed partners through ongoing community dialogue. The package includes replacing capital gains tax on trading with a stamp duty, alongside other incentives to encourage company listings on the Egyptian Exchange; simplifying and accelerating VAT refund procedures; allowing set-off against credit balances; launching a mobile application for real estate transactions; and fixing the real estate transaction tax at 2.5% of the unit’s sale value for individuals, regardless of the number of transactions.
Additional measures include reducing VAT on medical devices from 14% to 5% and launching an electronic advisory platform to provide taxpayers with accurate and timely technical guidance.
The minister also said that ten facilitations are being targeted within the real estate tax system to simplify procedures and ease burdens on citizens and investors. These include raising the exemption threshold for private residences to EGP 4m, allowing tax write-offs where warranted, submitting a single simplified tax return regardless of the number of properties owned, and recognising electronic payment methods.
Kouchouk noted that the Ministry of Finance is coordinating with the Ministry of Investment to implement clear measures to improve the trade system, reduce customs clearance times and support industry and exports. These measures include customs facilitations to stimulate transit trade, the introduction of a comprehensive risk management system, new incentives for participants in the Authorised Economic Operator programme, and the unification and acceleration of customs procedures across all ports to boost foreign trade activity.
He stressed that the government is also working to remove what he described as a “black cloud” weighing on development efforts, through impactful measures aimed at reducing the size and burden of debt related to budgetary entities.
For his part, Deputy Minister for Tax Policies Sherif El-Kilany said the Advance Cargo Information (ACI) system was instrumental in enabling rapid progress towards customs facilitation measures. He noted that modernising the customs system helps reduce clearance times, strengthen governance and enhance the competitiveness of the Egyptian economy.
Omar Mohanna, Chairperson of the Egyptian Centre for Economic Studies, expressed appreciation for the ongoing tax transformation aimed at building a partnership with the business community based on trust and certainty, adding that he looks forward to completing this reform path to achieve tangible improvements in tax services.
Meanwhile, Abla Abdel Latif, Executive Director and Director of Research at the Centre, said that, at the request of the Ministry of Finance, the Centre is currently preparing a comprehensive and independent evaluation of the outcomes of the first package of tax reforms. She noted that this marks the first time a neutral research institution has undertaken an assessment of government performance on this scale.
Abdel Latif called on other institutions to adopt similar independent evaluation approaches to ensure efficiency, transparency and a clearer understanding of the real impact of economic policies on the business environment.",749,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.812461793422699,2025-12-30T09:28:46.716590
2025-12-29,Egypt’s apparel exports exceed $3bn for first time,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/29/egypts-apparel-exports-exceed-3bn-for-first-time/,"Egypt’s ready-made garments sector has achieved a historic milestone, with exports surpassing $3bn for the first time, according to the Apparel Export Council of Egypt (AECE).
The council said total garment exports reached approximately $3.1bn between January and November 2025, marking the highest level ever recorded by the industry. This represents annual growth of 22%, up from $2.5bn in 2024.
Fadel Marzouk, Chairperson and CEO of the AECE, said the record-breaking performance capped a year of exceptional growth driven by substantial development within the domestic industry and capacity expansions by existing Egyptian factories, which currently account for 63% of total garment exports.
Marzouk noted that the achievement is particularly significant as it was realised entirely through the capabilities and expansion of existing factories, highlighting the efficiency, resilience and global competitiveness of Egyptian-made apparel.
He added that the milestone was reached before the full impact of major new foreign investments, many of which are still in preparation or trial-operation phases.
According to Marzouk, export data reflect sustained and progressive improvement in the performance of exporting factories throughout the year, while the Export Council’s strategy to expand Egypt’s presence in international markets played a pivotal role in driving growth.
He also highlighted the Egyptian government’s strong commitment and concrete measures to support exports and push them towards record-breaking levels.
Marzouk said the direct impact of new investments—and the significant production capacities they will add—is expected to be clearly reflected in export figures during 2026 and 2027. These expansions, he added, will boost export-oriented production and further strengthen Egypt’s position as a leading regional hub for the apparel industry.
He projected that garment exports could exceed $4bn for the first time in the coming period, supported by the integration of existing industrial expertise with advanced technologies introduced by incoming investments. This aligns with the state’s broader strategy to expand non-oil exports and increase foreign currency inflows.
Marzouk affirmed continued coordination with relevant government authorities to overcome production challenges and ensure an attractive investment climate that encourages further capital inflows—supporting the sustainability of this historic growth and reinforcing the apparel sector’s role within Egypt’s national economy.
On a monthly basis, garment exports in November 2025 rose by 18% year-on-year to $281m. February recorded the highest monthly growth rate at 30%, while July registered the highest export value, with shipments reaching $326m.",387,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.954874873161316,2025-12-30T09:28:49.459290

The increase of $707m represents year-on-year growth of 13%.

Key export destinations
Commodity performance
In a statement, the Council said the performance confirms the sector’s position as a key pillar of Egypt’s non-oil exports, accounting for approximately 14% of total non-petroleum exports and ranking third among the country’s largest exporting sectors.
Resilience despite global economic headwinds
Mahmoud Bazan, chairperson of the Food Export Council, said the positive indicators recorded through the end of November 2025 reflect the effectiveness of state policies aimed at supporting production and boosting exports. He added that the sector has demonstrated a strong capacity to maintain sustainable growth despite continued global economic uncertainty.
Bazan noted that the consistent achievement of record export levels signals a qualitative shift in the structure of Egypt’s food exports, supported by wider product diversification, higher value-added manufacturing and the expansion of export destinations.
Stronger presence in advanced markets
The FEC chairperson highlighted notable growth in exports to the United States and the European Union, among the world’s most tightly regulated food markets in terms of safety and technical standards.
He said the sustained expansion in these markets provides clear evidence of improvements across Egypt’s food manufacturing system, including higher production efficiency and full compliance with US and European regulatory requirements. This progress, he added, has strengthened confidence among international importers in the quality and safety of Egyptian food products.
Bazan also stressed that the sector’s performance is contributing to increased foreign currency inflows and supporting the balance of payments, reflecting effective coordination between regulatory authorities, technical support bodies and export institutions.
Targets for full-year 2025
According to Bazan, the food industries sector is targeting exports of around $6.8bn by the end of 2025, representing an increase of no less than $700m compared with 2024 and a growth rate of approximately 12%.
He said this outlook is supported by strong performance in the final quarter of the year and growing global demand for Egyptian food products certified under an integrated national regulatory framework.
Key export destinations
Data released by the Food Export Council show that Arab countries remained the largest importing markets for Egyptian food products between January and November 2025, with imports valued at $3.127bn, representing 49% of total exports. This marked growth of 4%, or an increase of $130m, compared with the same period last year.
The European Union ranked second, with exports totalling $1.263bn, accounting for 20% of total exports, and recording growth of 15%, equivalent to an increase of $168m. Exports to non-Arab African markets reached $469m, representing 8% of total exports, with performance broadly unchanged year on year.
Exports to the United States recorded particularly strong growth, reaching $402m, an increase of 35%, or $105m. Meanwhile, exports to the rest of the world amounted to $1.077bn, posting robust growth of 40%, or $307m.
Commodity performance
Analysis of the commodity structure of food industry exports during the period shows continued strong performance across a wide range of products, reflecting the diversity of Egypt’s production base and rising demand for higher value-added food products.
Frozen strawberries led export growth, with shipments valued at $672m, compared with around $370m a year earlier, marking record growth of 81% and an increase of $302m, driven by rising demand in European and US markets.
Cola concentrate ranked second, with exports reaching $533m, recording growth of 5%, reflecting stable global demand and Egypt’s role as a key manufacturing hub.
Edible oils achieved strong growth, with exports rising to $405m, compared with around $285m in the previous year, posting growth of 42% and an increase of $119m, supported by stronger regional demand and expanded production capacity.
By contrast, sugar exports declined to $353m, down 6%, or $24m, reflecting global price volatility and shifting demand patterns. Preparations based on cereals and biscuits recorded exports of $340m, up 42%, or $100m, driven by rising demand in Arab and African markets for processed food products.
Flour and milling products fell to around $304m, recording a decline of 32%, or $145m, due to changes in import policies and weaker demand in some key markets. Frozen vegetables remained relatively stable at $240m, with growth of 1%, while frozen potatoes achieved growth of 16%, also reaching $240m, supported by increased demand from global retail and foodservice sectors.
Exports of prepared animal food products rose sharply to $231m, recording growth of 51%, as demand expanded in African and Asian markets. Chocolate exports reached $232m, up 45%, driven by stronger demand in Arab and African markets, while juice exports declined to $209m, down 21%, amid intensifying competition in several destinations.
Overall, the main food commodities accounted for around 89% of total Egyptian food industry exports during the first eleven months of 2025, with a combined value of $5.653bn out of total exports of $6.339bn, underscoring the sector’s strong export concentration and growing international footprint.",855,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9597265720367432,2025-12-30T09:29:07.755199

Ehab Wassef, Head of the Gold and Precious Metals Division, stated that the price of 21-karat gold rose by 4.59%, equivalent to EGP 265 per gram. Trading opened at EGP 5,775 per gram at the beginning of the week and closed at EGP 6,040 per gram, with prices ranging between a weekly low of EGP 5,775 and a high of EGP 6,040.
Wassef explained that the sharp rise in local gold prices was primarily driven by the historic rally in global gold markets, which has become the dominant pricing factor in Egypt amid the stability of the dollar exchange rate in banks and the absence of significant currency fluctuations. As a result, local gold price movements have closely mirrored changes in global ounce prices.
He added that global gold prices continued to rise for the third consecutive week, supported by increased demand for safe-haven assets amid escalating geopolitical tensions and a weakening US dollar, factors that were directly reflected in the local market.
The global price of gold rose by 4.5% over the past week, reaching a new all-time high of $4,550 per ounce. Trading opened at $4,340 per ounce and closed at $4,533 per ounce.
Wassef noted that global gold prices successfully broke through the psychological level of $4,500 per ounce, supported by strong upward momentum despite being in overbought territory. He indicated that prices are currently targeting the resistance level of $4,550 per ounce.
On the domestic front, Wassef said that 21-karat gold prices have stabilised above the EGP 6,000 per gram level after breaking through it over the past two days, supported by sufficient buying momentum. He added that the market is now anticipating a potential test of the EGP 6,050 per gram level in the coming period.
Wassef confirmed that geopolitical tensions were the main driver of gold’s performance during the week, particularly amid escalating disputes between the United States and Venezuela and continued US pressure on Venezuelan oil exports. These developments heightened concerns over supply disruptions and regional instability, prompting investors to increase their demand for gold as a safe-haven asset.",396,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9419028162956238,2025-12-30T09:29:13.027148

During the meeting, the Prime Minister stressed that entrepreneurship and support for startups are key drivers of economic growth and central pillars for achieving human development targets and the Sustainable Development Goals, which depend heavily on innovation across various economic and productive sectors. In this regard, he reaffirmed the government’s commitment to providing sustainable and comprehensive support for entrepreneurship through its relevant institutions.
For her part, Minister Al-Mashat outlined the results of ongoing coordination and intensive efforts by members of the Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship Advisory Committee and the Ministerial Group for Entrepreneurship. She highlighted the importance of policy integration across startups and scaleups, noting that such alignment is essential to building a strong and sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystem.
Al-Mashat explained that the Ministerial Group for Entrepreneurship has developed supportive policies targeting startups at the idea, establishment, and early growth stages, in line with Law No. 152 of 2020. She added that companies at the expansion, maturity, and exit stages require tailored tools, policies, and different forms of support—issues addressed through the “Egypt Startup Charter,” which aims to promote entrepreneurship, growth-oriented policies, and job creation within an integrated framework for startup development.
The Minister also noted that a series of meetings were held between the advisory committee, working groups, and startups to gather proposals and incorporate them into the Entrepreneurship Charter.
During the meeting, Al-Mashat reviewed a package of initiatives and policies that are ready for launch by the Ministerial Group for Entrepreneurship. These include the adoption of a unified definition of startups; a unified financing initiative; the establishment of an executive implementation mechanism; a dedicated scaleups program; a unified government services guide for startups (Navigator); the creation of a central communication point and dedicated website; and the launch of an Entrepreneurship Observatory.
She further referred to several government measures that have already been announced, including the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency (MSMEDA) and the “Erada” initiative to enhance the regulatory and legislative environment for entrepreneurship and SMEs; the approval by the Financial Regulatory Authority to establish Egypt’s first digital platform for investment in real estate investment fund certificates; and a strategic partnership between the Egyptian Intellectual Property Authority and the Innovators Support Fund to promote innovation.

The project is chaired by Kotb Mokhtar, with executive management led by Mohamed Hamdy, chief executive officer, and Ahmed Abdel Rahman, chief commercial officer.
Mokhtar said the project enjoys a strategic location near the Cairo–Alexandria Desert Road, El Nozha Street, Sphinx International Airport and the Grand Egyptian Museum, placing it within one of Sheikh Zayed’s fast-developing districts.
Naseem compound is being developed across 8.5 feddans, with a construction footprint of 27%, while the remaining area is dedicated to landscaped green spaces and artificial water features.

2025-12-28,Madbouly outlines new legislative framework to regulate Egypt’s real estate market,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/28/madbouly-outlines-new-legislative-framework-to-regulate-egypts-real-estate-market/,"Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said the government is working on a new legislative and institutional framework to better regulate Egypt’s real estate market, with the aim of enforcing market discipline, protecting citizens’ rights and supporting serious, financially capable developers.
Speaking last week, Madbouly said the government, in coordination with the Ministry of Housing and a group of leading real estate developers, is preparing what he described as a “filtering mechanism” for the sector. The proposed framework is designed to prevent major projects from being awarded to developers that lack the technical or financial capacity to deliver them.
Under the new system, real estate developers would be classified according to their financial solvency and execution track record, ensuring companies do not undertake projects beyond their capabilities. Madbouly said the classification would help safeguard buyers’ funds, reduce execution risks and prevent delays or project failures that could undermine market confidence.
The prime minister stressed that the forthcoming legislation seeks to strike a balanced approach between the interests of developers, citizens and the state. It aims to protect customers from delayed handovers or failure to meet agreed specifications, while preserving the state’s right to implement its urban development plans. At the same time, the framework is intended to support serious developers by simplifying procedures and enabling expansion under a clear and stable regulatory environment.
Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly
Addressing concerns over market conditions, Madbouly dismissed claims of a slowdown in the real estate sector, noting that property sales in 2025 exceeded those recorded in previous years. He said the sector continues to function as a safe store of value, with buying and selling activity remaining resilient despite inflationary pressures and wider economic challenges.
Madbouly also pointed to progress in establishing a unified real estate registration system through the national real estate identification number. He said coordination is underway with developers to list projects on the official Egypt Real Estate Platform, which aims to facilitate property sales to foreign investors and Egyptians living abroad, particularly in foreign currency, as part of efforts to boost real estate exports.
His remarks coincided with the Central Bank of Egypt’s recent decision to cut interest rates by 100 basis points, a move that government officials and market experts say could provide a boost to the real estate sector. Lower borrowing costs are expected to ease financing pressures on developers and stimulate mortgage lending, supporting demand in the period ahead.
Madbouly concluded that the government remains committed to building a more organised, transparent and sustainable real estate market that underpins long-term urban development while protecting investors, developers and citizens alike.",431,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.4945218563079834,2025-12-30T09:30:07.373875

El-Khatib affirmed the strong fraternal ties binding the two countries and their shared commitment to strengthening economic relations in line with their mutual aspirations. He reiterated Egypt’s readiness to support Sudan during its economic recovery phase by forging strategic partnerships and enhancing trade and investment linkages.
The minister stressed the importance of the committee’s regular convening, as well as sustained communication and coordination between the Egyptian and Sudanese sides at both governmental and private-sector levels, noting that such cooperation would help accelerate implementation and advance the two countries’ economic objectives.
For her part, Yaqoub said the committee’s meetings reflect the depth of relations between Egypt and Sudan and demonstrate the two countries’ willingness to join forces and pool efforts to achieve economic integration. She highlighted the need to further develop trade and investment relations, increase trade exchange, and expand cooperation in expertise-sharing and training in a manner commensurate with the close ties between the peoples of the Nile Valley and their shared interests.
Yaqoub also called for continued coordination and joint action to remove obstacles hindering the growth of bilateral trade, in line with the significant economic potential of both countries.
At the conclusion of the meetings, the two ministers signed the minutes of the committee’s proceedings, which included agreements across a number of priority areas. Both sides praised the existing level of economic cooperation between Cairo and Khartoum and stressed the importance of intensifying joint efforts to raise bilateral trade to levels that reflect the two countries’ potential and integration opportunities.
They noted that trade exchange between Egypt and Sudan reached approximately $1.15bn in 2024 and agreed to take all necessary measures to further increase trade volumes in a manner that meets the aspirations of both nations.
The two sides agreed on a package of measures and executive programmes to enhance economic integration, including the formation of a technical working group to boost trade exchange and identify priorities for merchandise trade. They also agreed to study a draft memorandum of understanding between Egypt’s General Authority for Investment and Free Zones and Sudan’s National Investment Authority to strengthen investment cooperation and facilitate the transfer of Egyptian expertise, particularly in free-zone management and the implementation of the one-stop-shop mechanism.
In addition, the two sides agreed to grant priority to Egyptian companies in Sudan’s reconstruction projects. Egypt also pledged to provide technical support to restart Sudanese factories damaged by the war and to begin training Sudanese customs personnel starting next January.

2025-12-28,Japan provides EGP 1bn grant to Egypt for Suez Canal diving support vessel,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/28/japan-provides-egp-1bn-grant-to-egypt-for-suez-canal-diving-support-vessel/,"Japan will provide an EGP 1bn ($22m) grant to Egypt to build and supply a first-of-its-kind diving support vessel (DSV) for the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) fleet, according to an executive agreement signed on Sunday.
The grant, provided through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), is intended to enhance maritime safety, emergency response, and the sustainable operation of the waterway. The signing ceremony was attended by Rania Al-Mashat, Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation, and Admiral Osama Rabie, Chairperson of the SCA. The agreement was signed by Ahmed El-Barbary, Director of the SCA Shipyards Department, and Yamamoto Atsushi, Senior Representative of the JICA Egypt Office, in the presence of Yusuke Suzuki, Economic Minister at the Japanese Embassy.
The DSV will perform multiple tasks, including towing, assisting ships in manoeuvring, and responding to maritime emergencies. Al-Mashat stated the agreement represents a qualitative partnership reflecting deep-rooted ties between the two nations, following directives from President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to benefit from Japanese developmental and technological expertise.
Al-Mashat noted that the Suez Canal handles approximately 12% of global trade and remains a primary component of Egypt’s gross domestic product. She added that while regional tensions since October 2023 caused a significant decline in traffic, navigation activity recovered to record 8.6% growth in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, following a peace agreement sponsored by President al-Sisi and a gradual return to stability in the Red Sea.
Rabiee described the DSV as an “unprecedented addition” to the SCA fleet that would significantly support marine rescue teams in diving, search, and recovery operations. He noted that the canal’s rescue capacity will be further bolstered next year with the addition of two rescue tugs with a 190-tonne bollard pull.
Suzuki, the Japanese Embassy’s economic minister, said the project is mutually beneficial and adds a new chapter to the strategic partnership. Atsushi, of JICA, highlighted that the partnership between JICA and the SCA has spanned nearly 70 years, stating the new vessel would reinforce the canal’s strategic position as a global maritime corridor.
The 45-metre vessel will be built entirely in Japan according to SOLAS requirements and under the supervision of the Japanese classification society NK. The 620-tonne unit features a dual-fuel engine (diesel and natural gas) to reduce carbon emissions.

2025-12-30,"CBE, Afreximbank sign MoU to launch pan-African Gold Bank programme in Egypt",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/30/cbe-afreximbank-sign-mou-to-launch-pan-african-gold-bank-programme-in-egypt/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and the African Export–Import Bank (Afreximbank) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish a pan-African Gold Bank programme, a strategic initiative aimed at formalising gold value chains, strengthening central bank reserves, and reducing Africa’s reliance on foreign refining and trading hubs.
The landmark MoU was signed by CBE Governor Hassan Abdalla and Afreximbank President and Chairperson of the Board of Directors, George Elombi, during a ceremony held at the Central Bank of Egypt.
The proposed Gold Bank programme aligns with Egypt’s vision to expand strategic partnerships and deepen cooperation with African countries across multiple sectors, as well as Afreximbank’s mandate to promote value addition and accelerate strategic mineral processing across the continent.
The partnership reflects a shared commitment by both institutions to support domestic manufacturing, advance sustainable development, and strengthen regional financial and trade integration—laying the foundation for a more resilient and sophisticated African economic ecosystem.
Under the MoU, the CBE and Afreximbank will collaborate on commissioning a feasibility study to assess the technical, commercial, and regulatory requirements for developing an integrated Gold Bank ecosystem within a designated free zone in Egypt, with the participation of African countries. The initiative envisages the establishment of an internationally accredited gold refinery, secure vaulting facilities, and related financial and trading services.
Beyond Egypt, the programme is designed to expand across the continent, engaging governments, central banks, mining companies, and industry stakeholders to enhance institutional cooperation, harmonise best practices, and facilitate the sustainable trade of gold and associated services throughout Africa.
Commenting on the agreement, Hassan Abdalla emphasised that the initiative represents a foundational step towards a broader pan-African framework that could engage African governments, central banks, and market participants. He reaffirmed Egypt’s commitment to advancing initiatives that promote continental economic integration, noting that Egypt’s potential role as a hub—subject to the outcomes of the feasibility study and regulatory approvals—reflects strong confidence in its capacity to host major continental projects. He added that Egypt’s strategic location at the crossroads of Africa, the Middle East, and Europe positions it as a natural hub for regional gold trade and financial innovation.
Speaking at the signing ceremony, George Elombi underscored the joint commitment of both institutions to close collaboration, aligning resources and efforts to promote financial stability and support sustainable economic growth across Africa.
“This signing ceremony may appear simple, yet it carries profound economic implications for our continent,” Elombi said. “It is a bold declaration that Africa’s gold must serve African people. This MoU, which forms part of Afreximbank’s vision to ensure Africa’s resources benefit Africans, lays the foundation for an African Gold Bank that will fundamentally transform how we extract, refine, manage, value, store, and trade our gold. By retaining value on the continent and building gold reserves—as other major economies have done—we enhance resilience, reduce vulnerability to external shocks, strengthen currency stability and convertibility, and generate wealth within Africa.”
Afreximbank and the Central Bank of Egypt share a long-standing partnership, with Egypt serving as both the Bank’s host country and its largest shareholder.",507,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8387256860733032,2025-12-31T09:29:22.382303
