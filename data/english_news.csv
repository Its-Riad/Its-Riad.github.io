2025-12-07,Egypt’s net international reserves rise to $50.215bn in November,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/egypts-net-international-reserves-rise-to-50-215bn-in-november/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) announced that the country’s net international reserves increased to $50.215bn in November 2025, up from $50.071bn in October, a rise of $144.4m.
The CBE noted that gold holdings within the reserves climbed to $17.252bn in November, compared to $16.545bn the previous month, marking an increase of $798m. Meanwhile, the value of foreign currencies in the reserves declined to $32.905bn, down from $33.350bn in October, a drop of $445m. Holdings of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) also fell to $61m, from $179m, reflecting a decrease of $118m.
Egypt’s foreign exchange reserves comprise a basket of major international currencies, including the US dollar, euro, pound sterling, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan. The allocation of these holdings is determined by exchange-rate movements and the relative stability of each currency in global markets, and is adjusted according to a strategy set by CBE officials.
The primary role of the reserves, made up of gold and foreign currencies, is to secure essential imports, meet external debt obligations, and provide a buffer during economic shocks, particularly when foreign-currency-generating sectors come under pressure.
Global ratings agency Fitch has projected that Egypt’s reserves will reach $52.6bn by the end of the current fiscal year, after hitting a record $50.1bn in October.
In a recent report, Fitch noted a significant uptick in portfolio investment since last August, driven by attractive yields, which has supported the pound’s improved performance against the US dollar. The agency expects the pound to maintain its strong trajectory into 2026, highlighting that net foreign assets in the banking sector reached their highest level since February 2020 as of October 2025.
While Fitch anticipates further interest-rate cuts by the CBE in the coming months, it said Egyptian bond yields are likely to remain appealing to investors.
“The improvement in the external sector will persist,” the agency added. “The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 3% of GDP in 2025/2026, supported by higher exports of goods and services and robust remittances from Egyptians working abroad.”",335,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9101063013076782,2025-12-08T21:28:39.786158
2025-12-08,"Egypt, France discuss ways to advance investment cooperation, streamline customs procedures",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/08/egypt-france-discuss-ways-to-advance-investment-cooperation-streamline-customs-procedures/,"The General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) held an expanded meeting with French Ambassador to Egypt Éric Chevallier and Egyptian Customs Authority Chairperson Ahmed Amoui, bringing together senior French officials and representatives of French companies operating in the Egyptian market to discuss ways to strengthen investment cooperation and improve the business environment.
The meeting included the participation of Pascal Forêt, Head of the Economic Department at the French Embassy in Cairo; Christelle Labernède, Country Director of Business France in Egypt; Laurent Pasquier, Regional Customs Attaché; and Mohamed Saad, Head of the Egypt branch of French Foreign Trade Advisors.
The discussions come within the framework of Egypt’s efforts to enhance the investment climate, modernise its regulatory environment, and attract further foreign direct investment.
Hossam Heiba, CEO of GAFI, underscored the important role of French investments in supporting Egypt’s economic growth, highlighting the continued expansion and diversification of French companies across the industrial and service sectors. Heiba noted that the government is implementing wide-ranging reforms to modernise the customs system, including accelerating pre-clearance procedures, expanding digital platforms, improving valuation methods, and reducing release times—measures that strengthen Egypt’s competitiveness and facilitate trade flows.
He emphasised that French investors can benefit from GAFI’s Permanent Unit for Investor Problem-Solving and the Investor Dispute Resolution Centre, which provide swift and effective mechanisms to address challenges and stabilise investment activities. Heiba added that the meeting marks the start of a regular dialogue platform between GAFI, the French Embassy, and French companies to discuss constraints and enhance the overall business environment.
For his part, Ambassador Chevallier reiterated France’s commitment to advancing economic and investment cooperation with Egypt, stressing that French companies are longstanding partners in supporting the Egyptian economy and expanding opportunities across multiple sectors. He added that periodic meetings between both sides provide an important avenue for exchanging expertise, addressing bottlenecks, and streamlining procedures for French investors.
Customs Authority Chairperson Ahmed Amoui presented the key customs reforms underway, particularly in simplifying procedures, expanding digital infrastructure, and accelerating trade flows in line with international best practices, ultimately improving services provided to investors.
A dedicated discussion session followed, during which representatives of French companies raised customs-related challenges and supply-chain issues, and explored opportunities to support the expansion and stability of French investments in Egypt. Participating companies included leading players in the automotive, energy, food, logistics, biotechnology, aviation, sports, and hospitality sectors, among them Valeo, Air Liquide, Bel, CMA CGM, bioMérieux, Dassault, SCAT, Decathlon, and Groupe Barrière.
Both sides concluded the meeting by expressing their commitment to continued coordination and joint work, affirming that constructive dialogue between Egyptian government institutions and French businesses is vital to supporting the investment community, facilitating smoother procedures, and strengthening economic ties between Egypt and France.",453,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7004396915435791,2025-12-08T21:29:08.690819

, although
the police force remains the sector perceived as most corrupt, a Transparency International Pakistan survey showed on Tuesday.
The National Corruption Perception Survey (
NCPS
) 2025 indicated that nearly 60% of respondents fully or partially agreed that the government had successfully stabilised the economy through its International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and by exiting the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list.
Furthermore, 66% of respondents stated they did not encounter a situation in the last 12 months where they felt compelled to pay a bribe to access public services.
Methodology and Scope
The survey, conducted from Sept. 22 to Sept. 29, 2025, expanded its sample size to 4,000 respondents across 20 districts. The exercise included urban and rural populations, persons with disabilities, and transgender persons to provide a more representative snapshot of public sentiment.
Transparency International Pakistan noted that the NCPS measures public “mood” and experiences rather than certifying actual corruption levels or investigating specific cases. As a domestic exercise, the findings do not alter Pakistan’s standing on the global Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI).
Sector Rankings and Improvements
While the police sector remained the
highest ranked
for perceived corruption at 24%,
the
figure reflected a 6% improvement in public perception
regarding
behaviour and service delivery.
Other institutions showing improved public perception included education, land and property, local government, and taxation.
Following the police, tendering and procurement ranked second at 16%, while the judiciary placed third at 14%.
Despite the acknowledgement of macroeconomic stabilisation, 57% of respondents reported that their purchasing power had decreased over the past year.
Institutional Reform and Accountability
The report highlighted a strong public demand for reform within oversight bodies. An overwhelming 78% of Pakistanis said anti-corruption institutions, such as the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), should themselves be answerable and transparent.
Respondents prioritised better accountability (26%), limiting discretionary powers (23%), and stronger Right to Information laws (20%) as the most effective measures to curb corruption.
“The NCPS 2025… highlights how people perceive and experience [corruption] in their daily interactions with public institutions,” said Justice (R) Zia Perwez, Chairman of Transparency International Pakistan.
Health and Political Finance
In the healthcare sector, Pakistanis outlined a blueprint for reform, favouring stricter controls on commissions paid by pharmaceutical companies to doctors (23%) and a ban on private practice by public sector doctors (20%).
Regarding political finance, a combined 83% of respondents supported either banning or strictly regulating business funding to political parties. Additionally, 55% supported a complete ban on the use of political parties’ names and leadership images in government advertisements.
The survey also found that 42% of Pakistanis would feel safe reporting corruption if strong whistleblower protection laws were in place, emphasising the need for anonymity and reward mechanisms.",479,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.5862776041030884,2025-12-08T21:29:14.016829

Korea hold meeting to tackle investment challenges, deepen economic cooperation",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/01/egypt-s-korea-hold-meeting-to-tackle-investment-challenges-deepen-economic-cooperation/,"Egypt’s General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) convened the inaugural meeting of the Egyptian-Korean Business and Investment Development Committee, with the participation of GAFI CEO Hossam Heiba and Hyundo Yi, Commercial Attaché at the South Korean Embassy in Cairo, alongside representatives from several Egyptian government bodies and major Korean companies operating in the country.
The launch of the committee reflects Egypt’s commitment, through the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade and GAFI, to strengthening its economic partnership with South Korea and resolving challenges facing Korean investors. The platform aims to create a more attractive and stable investment climate through direct dialogue between government institutions and the Korean business community.
During the meeting, Heiba emphasised that cooperation with South Korea is a key pillar of Egypt’s strategy to reinforce economic ties. He highlighted GAFI’s ongoing reforms to streamline procedures, accelerate licensing, and enhance investor services through the digitisation of all investment-related processes.
Heiba noted that GAFI is finalising a unified digital platform that will provide all investor services, including licences, approvals and electronic tracking of applications, designed to improve transparency, efficiency and reduce human intervention. He added that full procedural reengineering, carried out with an international-Egyptian consortium, will begin in January 2026. This includes expanding the “golden licence” system and improving customs clearance to boost the business environment and attract more foreign investment, particularly from South Korea.
Heiba underscored the importance of direct coordination with all relevant government entities to address challenges facing Korean companies in Egypt. He affirmed that GAFI is closely monitoring these issues and developing an executive plan to resolve them, with priority given to eliminating obstacles and ensuring systematic follow-up to support the expansion and sustainability of Korean investments.
For his part, Yi said the meeting reflects the growing mutual interest in advancing economic cooperation. He expressed appreciation for Egypt’s efforts and noted that many Korean companies are successfully operating across key sectors of the Egyptian market. He stressed the importance of addressing investor concerns and fostering a supportive environment for growth and expansion.
GAFI’s Investor Follow-up Department presented recent achievements in aftercare services and outlined executive measures taken to improve the business climate and streamline procedures. The overview reaffirmed the state’s commitment to supporting existing investors and facilitating their growth.
The meeting also featured an open discussion with Korean companies, led by the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA). Participating firms highlighted the key challenges they face in the Egyptian market, while representatives from GAFI, the Central Bank of Egypt, and the Customs and Tax Authorities responded to these concerns and explained available solutions—underscoring the state’s commitment to active engagement and rapid, systematic problem-solving.
Both sides expressed their desire for continued cooperation and regular coordination, agreeing that this constructive dialogue represents an important step toward supporting the business community and facilitating the flow of Korean investments into Egypt in a manner that serves the economic interests of both countries.
The meeting saw broad participation from major Korean companies involved in electronics, electrical industries, TV and mobile phone manufacturing, razor blade production, chemicals, steel, logistics, ready-made garments, power and telecom cables, and packaging materials. Companies operating in nuclear energy, natural resource development, international trade, and railway equipment design and manufacturing also took part, reflecting the depth and diversity of Korean interest in expanding investment cooperation with Egypt.",551,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8331554532051086,2025-12-08T21:29:19.229975
2025-08-30,CBE projects inflation to ease to 14–15% in 2025,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/08/30/cbe-projects-inflation-to-ease-to-14-15-in-2025/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) expects headline inflation to decline to between 14% and 15% in 2025, after slowing to 15.2% in the second quarter compared with 16.5% in the first. The projection was announced following the latest meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which cut key interest rates by two percentage points in a move intended to support the disinflationary trend.
The overnight deposit rate was lowered to 22%, the overnight lending rate to 23%, while both the main operation rate and the credit and discount rate were set at 22.5%. The MPC explained that the decision reflected its assessment of recent inflation developments and expectations, building on signs of easing pressures across the domestic economy.
Globally, recent months have seen a gradual recovery in growth alongside stabilising inflation expectations. This has encouraged central banks in advanced and emerging markets to ease monetary policy, albeit cautiously, given continuing uncertainty. Commodity markets remain mixed, with oil prices fluctuating due to supply dynamics, while agricultural prices have followed divergent paths. Despite these developments, risks to global growth and inflation persist, particularly from geopolitical tensions and disruptions to trade policy.
Domestically, preliminary CBE data suggest stronger-than-expected economic growth in the second quarter of 2025, supported mainly by non-oil manufacturing and tourism. Real GDP is now projected to expand by 5.4% in the quarter, with the fiscal year 2024/2025 expected to record average growth of 4.5%, compared with 2.4% in 2023/2024. Labour market conditions also improved, with unemployment falling to 6.1% in the second quarter, down from 6.3% in the first.
Inflation data show further signs of relief. Annual headline inflation slowed to 13.9% in July 2025, from 14.9% in June, while core inflation was broadly stable at 11.6% compared with 11.4% a month earlier. On a monthly basis, both headline and core inflation recorded negative rates in July, at -0.5% and -0.3% respectively, marking a second consecutive month of contraction. These negative monthly readings underline the easing of inflationary pressures and point to improved expectations, supported by monetary policy and more stable exchange rate conditions.
The CBE therefore expects inflation to average between 14% and 15% over the course of 2025, before gradually approaching its target range. According to the outlook, inflation is forecast to converge towards the CBE’s target of 7% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2026, and further towards 5% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2028.
Nevertheless, the MPC cautioned that the inflation path remains exposed to several upside risks. Chief among these are the possibility of administered price adjustments exceeding expectations, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions that could disrupt global supply chains and commodity markets.
Against this backdrop, the Committee judged that cutting policy rates by 200 basis points was appropriate to maintain a monetary stance that anchors expectations and supports the anticipated decline in inflation. The MPC stressed that future policy decisions will continue to be data-dependent, taken on a meeting-by-meeting basis, and guided by inflation expectations, risk assessments, and domestic and external developments.
The Committee reaffirmed its commitment to closely monitor economic and financial conditions and to deploy all available instruments to safeguard price stability.",523,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9495778679847716,2025-12-08T21:29:29.355972

2025-11-22,CBE outlines drivers behind October’s rise in inflation,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/22/cbe-outlines-drivers-behind-octobers-rise-in-inflation/,"Annual urban headline inflation accelerated to 12.5% in October 2025, up from 11.7% in September, according to data released by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE).
The CBE said the acceleration was primarily driven by higher services prices, especially imputed residential rents, in addition to an uptick in volatile food prices.
Non-food inflation rose to 20.4% in October, compared with 19.1% in September, while annual food inflation edged up slightly to 1.5%, from 1.4% a month earlier.
Annual core inflation also accelerated, reaching 12.1% in October 2025 from 11.3% in September. On a monthly basis, core inflation stood at 2% in October, compared with 1.3% in the same month last year.
The CBE noted that the October increase was mainly driven by a pickup in services inflation, led by a sharp 17.5% rise in imputed rents for housing.
Monthly urban headline inflation rose to 1.8% in October 2025, compared with 1.1% in October 2024. The monthly increase was largely attributable to higher prices of fresh vegetables and services, with retail goods also contributing to a lesser extent.
In rural areas, annual headline inflation decelerated to 7.8% in October, from 8.9% in September. Nationwide, annual headline inflation remained broadly stable at 10.1%, compared with 10.3% a month earlier.
Monthly food inflation reached 1.2% in October, contributing 0.5% to monthly headline inflation.
October’s food inflation was driven by:
A 5% increase in volatile food items, adding 0.32% to monthly headline inflation. While fresh fruit prices fell by 7.6%, fresh vegetables surged by 14.7%, both in line with typical seasonal patterns.
A 5% rise in egg prices, contributing 0.08%.
Monthly non-food inflation recorded 2.2% in October, contributing 1.38% to monthly headline inflation.
The CBE said the rise in non-food inflation was mainly due to:
A 4.5% increase in services prices, adding 1.25% to monthly headline inflation. This was largely driven by the 17.5% rise in imputed housing rents, which alone contributed 1.18%, alongside a slight increase in restaurant and café prices.
A 0.5% increase in retail items, contributing 0.07%, mainly due to slightly higher prices for clothing and footwear, cleaning products, and personal care items.
A 0.2% rise in regulated prices, contributing 0.05%, reflecting a 0.5% increase in tobacco prices and a 0.6% rise in LPG cylinder prices.
Monthly core inflation stood at 2% in October 2025, reflecting the combined impact of changes in core CPI components. Services accounted for 1.74% of the monthly core inflation rate, while core food and retail items contributed 0.20% and 0.10%, respectively.",415,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8845880627632141,2025-12-08T21:29:37.213040
2025-12-07,Egyptian developers offer unprecedented cash discounts amid mounting market pressures,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/egyptian-developers-offer-unprecedented-cash-discounts-amid-mounting-market-pressures/,"“It is impossible for residential unit prices to drop, unlike cars,” said Osama Saad, CEO of the Real Estate Development Chamber, as developers grapple with rising costs and shifting market conditions.
Saad explained that recent fluctuations in the exchange rate and construction material prices prompted a series of meetings with developers to explore potential price reductions. However, it was agreed that unit prices in projects where one or two phases have already been sold will remain unchanged. Instead, developers are offering additional in-kind benefits, such as upgraded finishing packages or contributions toward club memberships, to attract buyers without altering base prices.
In recent months, the market has seen cash payment discounts exceeding 50%, an unprecedented level for Egypt’s real estate sector. Several developers have introduced these aggressive offers to boost liquidity and maintain construction momentum amid rising costs and tightening financing conditions. Traditionally, cash discounts have ranged from 25% to 30%, but recent pressures have pushed them significantly higher.
In East Cairo, particularly the New Administrative Capital, Mostakbal City, and the Fifth Settlement, cash discounts ranged between 25% and 50%. In West Cairo, projects recorded discounts of around 30%. Madinet Masr stood out by offering what marketers say is the highest announced cash discount so far: 55% for immediate full payments.
Abdallah Sallam, President and CEO of Madinet Masr, said the company’s offers reflect current purchasing power and evolving customer preferences. Madinet Masr, he explained, continuously designs flexible payment plans tailored to diverse client segments. The current discount levels, he noted, align with prevailing interest rates and offer buyers a balanced financial alternative.
Sallam emphasised that upfront-payment incentives aim to stimulate demand and provide practical solutions in the current economic environment. These offers help companies reinforce cash flow, supporting construction and operational commitments. He added that such approaches bolster the appeal of real estate as a stable investment while ensuring Madinet Masr’s long-term financial and operational resilience.
However, not all industry voices are optimistic. Mohamed Samir, CEO of Elite Consulting, said the steep cash discounts signal mounting pressures in the market. He warned that the sector faces a “real crisis” that could intensify in the first and second quarters of 2026 due to liquidity shortages, slowing sales, and rising rates of unit returns.
Samir noted that Egypt lacks a robust mortgage financing system capable of supporting demand, leaving developers dependent on cash discounts to secure liquidity. Much of this cash, he added, is directed toward covering immediate financial obligations and completing ongoing projects. Access to bank financing remains limited, available only to a small number of large developers and often requiring lengthy processing times, which weakens financial sustainability across the sector.
He highlighted that 2022 and 2023 witnessed a surge in new project launches and strong sales, with many units scheduled for delivery in 2026. But current liquidity constraints and slowing sales could affect delivery timelines and challenge some developers’ ability to meet obligations to clients.
Abd Elrahman Abozeid, Senior Sales Team Leader at Taskeen, a subsidiary of Nawy specialising in proptech solutions, said the large cash discounts have generated “noticeable movement” in the real estate market in recent months. He noted that the offers have boosted demand for ready units and projects nearing completion. While upfront-payment discounts in such projects typically remain below 50%, they tend to increase as construction advances.
Abozeid added that the primary objective of these offers is to stimulate sales and secure the cash flow required to complete projects. Discount levels, he said, vary based on the size of the upfront payment and the conditions of each project.",593,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8838165998458862,2025-12-08T21:29:40.052171

This move is part of Egypt’s broader efforts to improve the business climate and offer more efficient, transparent services to investors.
The announcement followed the final meeting of the technical committee overseeing the review and update of the framework, chaired by GAFI CEO Hossam Heiba. The session also included key participants such as Dalia El-Hawary, Deputy CEO for Institutional Development, Research, and Economic Performance, along with experts from prominent Egyptian and international audit firms and relevant authorities.
The committee focused on streamlining accounting standards, improving procedures for mergers, demergers, and corporate restructurings, and reviewing the technical treatment of companies’ financial frameworks. Additionally, the committee developed a comprehensive approach for pre-investment financial reviews, aligning with international best practices while addressing practical challenges and proposing measures to support Egypt’s digital transformation.
CEO Hossam Heiba highlighted that the updated framework is crucial for strengthening Egypt’s investment environment. It will foster greater transparency, improve technical accuracy, and better meet investor needs. He also emphasized that GAFI’s ongoing modernization efforts aim to digitize services and enhance the quality of services in line with global standards and Egypt’s investment priorities.
“We will closely monitor the implementation of these reforms, gather stakeholder feedback, and continue making improvements,” said Heiba, stressing the importance of regular follow-up meetings to track progress and achieve long-term institutional impact.
El-Hawary added that the committee used an in-depth analytical approach, examining existing models and international case studies to develop actionable recommendations for improving valuation and financial review processes. She emphasized that the new framework will boost the reliability and consistency of valuation results across GAFI’s technical departments.
As part of its digital transformation initiative, GAFI also introduced a new online platform for financial review services. The platform allows investors to submit requests, track their status, and receive real-time updates and notifications, marking a significant shift toward greater digital integration and efficiency. This initiative aims to reduce review times, enhance transparency, and improve communication with investors.
GAFI stated that the updated framework and digital platform are part of a wider series of reforms designed to improve Egypt’s competitiveness, attract both domestic and foreign investment, and strengthen investor confidence. The authority is committed to closely monitoring these reforms to ensure their successful implementation and positive impact on the business community.",401,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.5446624159812927,2025-12-08T21:29:42.887197

sat down with Olivia Toderean, Ambassador of Romania to Egypt, to discuss the roadmap for this milestone. From unlocking trade potential and navigating regional geopolitical challenges to fostering a modern cultural dialogue, Ambassador Toderean shares her vision for a partnership that honors the past while aggressively pursuing the opportunities of the future.
Beyond the Celebration: Our nations are approaching a remarkable milestone: 120 years of continuous diplomatic relations. Your Excellency, the 120th anniversary is a powerful symbol. But to make it truly meaningful, it must be a catalyst for action. When you stand alongside your Egyptian counterparts on April 1, 2026, what specific, tangible outcome—be it a major trade agreement, a new investment project, or a strategic policy declaration—do you hope to announce that will define the next chapter of our relationship?
You are absolutely right, and I believe this is the approach both in Bucharest and in Cairo. While some of the preparations are too early to reveal, I can assure you they are substantial. It is clear that the 120th anniversary of Romanian–Egyptian diplomatic relations is not only a moment of celebration but also an excellent opportunity to project our partnership into the future.
Over the past century, our nations have built relations of trust, solidarity, and respect—from political dialogue to economic and cultural exchanges, as well as educational cooperation. Now, as we approach this milestone, our priority is to translate that history into new, tangible achievements. We would like the anniversary to be marked by more than symbolic gestures. Together with our Egyptian partners, we are working so that throughout 2026 we can announce a set of flagship outcomes that will truly define the next chapter of our relations.
Beyond government-to-government agreements, we also want this anniversary to bring benefits felt by our peoples. We are therefore paying close attention to fostering people-to-people contacts, cultural and academic partnerships, and opportunities for young generations to know and understand each other better.
In short, what matters most is that this anniversary should leave behind more than memories. It should create the foundation for new opportunities, sustainable development, innovation, and deepening the friendship that has linked Romania and Egypt for over a century. The fact that Romania will be the Guest of Honor at the Cairo International Book Fair 2026—a flagship cultural event that highlights the rich cultural tapestry of Egypt—is just one of the significant projects for 2026. We will bring numerous Egyptian and Romanian writers, cultural debates, workshops, and round tables to our national pavilion. I promise you there will be many pleasant surprises that will attract our Egyptian readers and expand the circles of our Egyptian friends.
Olivia Toderean
Reimagining the Pillars: For decades, this relationship was built on solid pillars: political solidarity, cultural exchange, and educational ties that saw thousands of Egyptians study in Romania. Looking forward, what do you believe should be the new pillars of the Egypt-Romania strategic relationship in the 21st century? Are they in energy, digital transformation, and logistics, or something else entirely?
Indeed, the traditional pillars of our bilateral relationship remain a living foundation that continues to inspire us today. However, in the 21st century, it is our duty to contextualize these pillars differently. The world around us is transforming at an unprecedented pace, and Romania and Egypt, both situated at geopolitical crossroads, have a special responsibility to adapt and innovate together.
Looking forward, we see
energy
—with a focus on renewables and the broader green transition—as a natural area of cooperation. Both Romania and Egypt are investing in sustainable energy solutions, and there is great potential to connect our efforts, whether in technology, innovation, investment, or joint projects that serve our citizens and contribute to climate resilience.
Logistics and connectivity
are another strategic field. Egypt plays a central role as a regional hub through the Suez Canal and its modernized ports, while Romania represents a gateway to the European Union, the Black Sea, and Eastern Europe.

Linking these advantages in a more systematic way could position our countries as essential partners in ensuring supply chain resilience between Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.
We are also convinced that
digital transformation
and the knowledge economy must be at the heart of the new agenda. Digital skills, artificial intelligence, and the integration of new technologies into health, education, and governance are areas where Romania has experience as a European IT hub, and where Egypt’s young and dynamic population offers extraordinary potential.
At the same time, I would emphasize that people-to-people connections will remain the soul of our relationship. The ties that once brought Egyptian doctors, engineers, and artists to study in Romania can now evolve into new forms of cooperation. So, to answer your question: the new pillars will certainly include energy, digital innovation, and connectivity, but they must also be complemented by the timeless human dimension—education, culture, and direct
Unlocking Trade Potential: Our bilateral trade is healthy, but many analysts believe it is performing below its potential. What are the key barriers preventing more Romanian companies from entering the Egyptian market, and how can we better position Egyptian exports to find a home in Romania and the wider EU market?
You are right to point out that our bilateral trade, while solid and growing, has not yet reached its full potential. I must recognize that the trend of 2024 was slightly disappointing compared to recent years, but in the first half of 2025, there seems to be a bounce back—I am eagerly looking forward to the figures at the end of this year.
The complementarities are evident: Romanian expertise in IT, cybersecurity, automotive components, and advanced agriculture pairs well with Egypt’s role as a manufacturing hub and a market of over 100 million people.
Barriers do exist, such as limited mutual visibility. Romanian SMEs may be unfamiliar with the Egyptian business culture, just as Egyptian exporters may find EU standards complex. We also need stronger logistical and financial connectivity. However, these are not structural roadblocks; they are challenges that can be addressed with targeted policies.
Regarding Egyptian exports, the answer lies in moving up the value chain. Beyond traditional goods, there is real potential for processed food products, textiles with higher value-added, chemicals, fertilizers, and renewable energy technologies. Romania, with its Black Sea ports and modern transport links into Central and Western Europe, can serve as an entry point for these Egyptian products into the EU single market.
The Energy Bridge: Black Sea to the Mediterranean: Romania is a significant energy producer in Europe. Egypt is positioning itself as a major regional energy hub for LNG and green hydrogen. How do you envision a strategic energy partnership between our two countries?
Energy is without a doubt one of the most promising areas of the Romanian–Egyptian partnership. There is an ongoing dialogue between EGAS and its Romanian counterpart, Transgaz, on joint projects of significance. CisGaz from Romania has developed a series of projects in partnership with Town Gas in Egypt, taking place in both countries. We are currently supporting other emerging projects in green energy, and hopefully, I will be able to share good news by next year in this field too.
Romania is already a significant energy producer in Europe. Except for peak periods in winter, we will be self-sufficient with a mix of green, nuclear, and gas-based production. Egypt has ambitious plans for green hydrogen and solar energy. We can certainly collaborate in energy engineering and technology, including offshore exploration.
Port to Port: Constanța and the Suez Canal: How can we create a more robust logistical and trade corridor between our key ports?
The Port of Constanța and the Suez Canal are not only vital for our respective countries but for global trade. If we think strategically, linking these two gateways more closely could create a powerful corridor between Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
I also see great potential in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE), a priority I am actively promoting to Romanian companies. For those seeking to expand into Africa and the Gulf, the SCZONE offers a unique platform. Positioning the zone as a natural destination for Romanian business—in industries ranging from agri-food to light manufacturing and IT—would give our partnership a tangible, future-oriented dimension.
A Bridge to Brussels: As an influential EU member state, how can Bucharest help shape a more nuanced and supportive EU policy toward Egypt?
Romania has always valued its role as a constructive bridge between the European Union and the wider Middle East. The context is very favorable to EU-Egypt relations—the only strategic and comprehensive partnership the EU has signed so far.
On water security and the Nile, Romania encourages dialogue that acknowledges Egypt’s vital interests. On regional stability, we promote balanced policies that reflect Egypt’s indispensable role in maintaining peace. This positioning was proven once again by the overwhelming majority of Romanian MPs who voted in favor of the European Parliament’s adoption of the €4 billion macro-financial assistance package for Egypt in April 2025.
The Ukraine War: What is your message to the Egyptian people about the resilience of the Black Sea grain corridor and Europe’s long-term strategy to ensure global food supply chains?
Romania has been at the frontline of the geopolitical and humanitarian crisis triggered by Russia’s war against Ukraine. To mitigate the dire consequences on food security, Romania took decisive steps to ensure that Ukrainian grain reaches global markets—over 50 million tons have transited our country. Moving from zero transit before the war to millions of tons per year was an enormous logistical challenge, but we remained committed.
At the same time, we are doing our own homework to increase our food exports. Keep in mind that Romania has been the 3rd largest exporter of wheat to Egypt in recent years, and we are actively working to enhance this market share.
The Gaza Crisis: What role can Romania play in supporting mediation and humanitarian relief?
Romania has always believed in dialogue, balance, and respect for international law. From Cairo, I have the privilege of listening closely to Egyptian interlocutors who are at the heart of mediation efforts. We support Egypt’s mediation role as indispensable.
Romania has supported the vision of two states—Israel and Palestine—living side by side in peace and security for decades. We also emphasize the humanitarian dimension. Romania has contributed aid and executed international evacuations to EU Member States for urgent medical cases, especially children. Around 50 children are currently being treated in Romanian hospitals, accompanied by approximately 100 family members.
Revitalizing Educational Ties: How can we revive and modernize the educational bridge between our nations?
We are actively encouraging stronger links between Romanian and Egyptian universities through joint research initiatives and double-degree programs. For example, there are new discussions between Alexandria University and Babeș-Bolyai University regarding a partnership.
Beyond traditional programs, Romania is exploring opportunities in online learning and tech incubators. A recent success is the training program organized by the Romanian Silver Screen Film School in partnership with the American University in Cairo. The first edition was a success, and I hope to see it grow, as the film and entertainment industry can bring significant economic growth.
Beyond Dracula and the Pyramids: How can our two countries foster a more contemporary cultural exchange?
Moving “beyond Dracula and the Pyramids” means embracing the full richness of who we are today. Romania hosts world-class festivals like the Sibiu International Theater Festival (FITS) and the Transylvania International Film Festival (TIFF). Likewise, Egypt is witnessing a flourishing of theater, cinema, and design.
We need to make sure our modern stories reach wider audiences. I was incredibly proud when a Romanian film won the supreme trophy at the Cairo International Film Festival last year. In essence, Romania and Egypt both have stories to tell that are as modern and dynamic as our relations are ancient.
Finally, Madam Ambassador, when you look back on your time in Cairo, what is the one human connection or diplomatic breakthrough you hope to have fostered?
This is perhaps the most difficult question. As I am only approaching the middle of my mandate, it is too early to speak of a diplomatic breakthrough in retrospect. I promise to answer this in a special interview with
Daily News Egypt
as I approach the end of my tenure!
As for the human connection, I can already say there isn’t just one, but many. I have made friendships here that have changed me and will remain with me for a lifetime. These connections span culture, science, business, and civil society. Even at mid-mandate, I can say without hesitation that the human connections I’ve made in Cairo have been one of the greatest pleasant surprises I have experienced, not only as an ambassador but as a person.",2180,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.6098382472991943,2025-12-08T21:29:50.553068
2025-12-06,US warns NATO allies against ‘bullying’ American defence firms amid protectionism row,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/06/us-warns-nato-allies-against-bullying-american-defence-firms-amid-protectionism-row/,"US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau has criticised European NATO allies for prioritising domestic defence companies over American suppliers, warning partners against “bullying” US firms or excluding them from the continent’s rearmament efforts.
According to diplomatic sources cited by
Politico
, Landau delivered the admonition during a closed-door meeting of NATO foreign ministers on Wednesday, urging allies to ensure American contractors are not shut out of the market as Europe moves to bolster its military industry.
The intervention comes amid heightened transatlantic tensions over trade and defence spending, with Washington increasingly wary of European Union initiatives designed to foster “sovereign” military capabilities.
A US State Department official confirmed the substance of Landau’s message, stating he conveyed two primary points: the need for Europe to convert defence spending pledges into tangible capabilities, and a warning that “protectionist and exclusionary policies that shut out US companies undermine our collective defence”.
The meeting marked the first time in over two decades that a US Secretary of State has missed a NATO ministerial gathering, with Marco Rubio absent from the talks.
Transatlantic Trade Tensions
Landau’s comments reflect a broader strategy by the current US administration to pressure historic partners on trade terms. President Donald Trump has frequently criticised the EU for “unfair” treatment of the United States, while the bloc has previously described Washington’s trade demands as tantamount to “blackmail”.
The dispute over defence procurement arises as NATO allies have pledged to spend 5 per cent of GDP on defence by 2035. Concurrently, the EU is allocating €150bn in defence grants for joint procurement, implementing strict controls that encourage intra-European purchasing and reduce reliance on third countries.
Despite the friction, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte noted on Wednesday that allies, including Canada and European nations, have pledged $4bn to a NATO-backed plan funding US defence firms to supply Ukraine.
US Dominance and Market Share
American defence contractors are seeking to secure their position in the European market, which accounts for approximately 11 per cent of annual revenue for major players such as Lockheed Martin and RTX.
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), US firms have strengthened their global foothold, capturing 43 per cent of arms exports over the past five years, up from 35 per cent in the previous period.
In Europe, reliance on American hardware remains high. SIPRI data indicates that arms imports by European NATO members more than doubled between the 2015–2019 and 2020–2024 periods. The US supplied 64 per cent of these weapons, a significant increase from 52 per cent previously.
Thirteen European nations, including Britain, Germany, and Italy, have procured or ordered US-made F-35 fighter jets. European armies have also bolstered stocks of RTX’s Patriot air defence systems and HIMARS rocket launchers.
To maintain market access, US firms are deepening ties with European counterparts. Lockheed Martin is establishing missile production lines with Germany’s Rheinmetall, while a joint venture between Raytheon and European missile maker MBDA will produce Patriot missiles in Germany.
European Industry Growth
Europe’s domestic defence sector is also expanding after years of underinvestment. The AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) reported that the sector grew by 13.8 per cent in 2024, generating revenues of €183.4bn ($213bn). Employment in the sector rose by 8.6 per cent to 633,000 jobs.
However, the ASD warned of persistent challenges, including supply chain bottlenecks, shortages of raw materials and electronic components, high energy costs, and labour market constraints.
Micael Johansson, ASD prominent figure and CEO of Saab, told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday that the continent must persist in building its own industrial base.
“We have to ensure that the defence industry continues to support the building of European sovereign capabilities that enhance deterrence and defence,” Johansson said. “That cannot stop just because a ceasefire is reached or negotiations begin.”",633,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.901171326637268,2025-12-08T21:29:55.887628
2025-10-13,S&P Global Ratings upgrade signals renewed confidence in Egypt’s economy: CBE Governor,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/13/sp-global-ratings-upgrade-signals-renewed-confidence-in-egypts-economy-cbe-governor/,"Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) Hassan Abdalla welcomed S&P Global Ratings’ decision to upgrade Egypt’s sovereign credit rating, describing it as a clear reflection of growing international confidence in the national economy. He attributed the move to the success of recent monetary and structural reforms implemented by the government and the CBE.
Abdalla highlighted that the unification of Egypt’s exchange rate regime marked a pivotal step towards restoring market stability and boosting investor confidence. He noted that the improvement in external sector indicators and the rise in foreign exchange reserves demonstrate the effectiveness of the economic policies currently in place.
The governor reaffirmed the CBE’s commitment to maintaining disciplined monetary policies aimed at containing inflation, safeguarding financial stability, and ensuring sustainable economic growth. These efforts, he said, have strengthened the trust of international institutions and investors in Egypt’s economic outlook.
On Friday, S&P Global Ratings upgraded Egypt’s long-term sovereign credit rating to “B” from “B-” with a stable outlook—the first such upgrade in seven years. The agency explained that the decision reflects Egypt’s reform momentum over the past 18 months, including the liberalisation of the foreign exchange regime, which has supported a strong rebound in GDP growth during fiscal year 2025.
S&P further noted that Egypt’s shift to a flexible exchange rate regime has bolstered economic resilience, contributing to higher tourism revenues, robust remittance inflows, and stronger net financial inflows—all of which have improved the country’s external position.
In a related development, Fitch Ratings affirmed Egypt’s long-term foreign-currency rating at ‘B’ with a stable outlook, citing resilient economic performance, improving external indicators, and continued fiscal reform efforts despite regional challenges.
Both assessments, Abdalla said, underscore the success of Egypt’s ongoing reform agenda and its ability to navigate global and regional headwinds while maintaining economic stability and growth momentum.",301,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9568681716918944,2025-12-08T21:30:00.275855
2025-10-04,"Inflation expectations still face upside risks domestically, globally: CBE",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/04/inflation-expectations-still-face-upside-risks-domestically-globally-cbe/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has stated that inflation expectations remain exposed to upside risks stemming from both domestic and global factors, including regulated price adjustments exceeding projections and rising geopolitical tensions in the region.
At its meeting last Thursday, the CBE’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to reduce the bank’s key policy rates by 1 percentage point, setting the overnight deposit rate at 21%, the overnight lending rate at 22%, and both the main operation rate and the discount rate at 21.5%.
In a statement following the meeting, the MPC said the decision reflects its assessment of the latest inflation developments and the evolving outlook since its previous meeting, noting that the move aims to sustain the disinflation process while maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Global Context: Gradual Easing and Stable Inflation Expectations
On the global front, the Committee observed that recent indicators point to a moderate recovery in growth, accompanied by stable inflation expectations. As a result, many central banks in advanced and emerging economies have continued to ease monetary policy gradually, responding to fast-changing global conditions.
Oil prices have largely remained stable, though some recent upward pressures have emerged due to supply factors. Meanwhile, agricultural commodity prices have exhibited mixed but limited movements.
Despite these stabilising trends, the MPC warned that global growth and inflation remain vulnerable to several risks — most notably the potential escalation of geopolitical tensions and ongoing uncertainty surrounding global trade policies.
Domestic Economy: Growth Accelerates but Remains Below Potential
Domestically, Egypt’s real GDP growth accelerated to 5% in the second quarter (Q2) of 2025, up from 4.8% in the previous quarter. Consequently, average growth for FY 2024/2025 reached 4.4%, compared with 2.4% in FY 2023/2024.
This improvement was primarily driven by non-oil manufacturing, tourism, and trade, which collectively supported the ongoing recovery in economic activity.
However, the MPC noted that output still remains below potential, meaning that current levels of economic activity continue to support the anticipated short-term disinflation path. Under the present monetary policy stance, demand-side inflationary pressures are expected to stay contained.
Inflation Dynamics: Easing Headline and Core Rates
The Committee reported that annual headline inflation fell to 12% in August 2025, down from 13.9% in July, while annual core inflation declined to 10.7% from 11.6%.
This moderation, according to the MPC, reflects subdued monthly inflation developments in August — 0.4% for headline inflation and 0.1% for core inflation — largely driven by declining food prices and relative stability in non-food components.
The MPC highlighted that the broad-based easing in monthly inflation over the past three months signals improving inflation expectations and the gradual unwinding of previous supply shocks.
In light of these developments, CBE estimates indicate that inflation will continue to decelerate, averaging between 12% and 13% in the third quarter (Q3) of the current year, compared with 15.2% in the previous quarter.
Over the medium term, inflation is projected to continue its downward trend, albeit at a slower pace, shaped by gradual declines in non-food inflation and the impact of ongoing fiscal consolidation measures.
Policy Outlook: Sustaining the Disinflation Path
According to the MPC’s projections, average headline inflation is expected to hover around 14% in 2025, approaching the CBE’s target range by Q4 2026.
“Given the progress achieved in disinflation and the improved inflation outlook, the Committee judged that cutting the CBE’s key policy rates by 100 basis points was appropriate to anchor expectations and support the anticipated disinflation path,” the statement said.
The MPC reaffirmed its data-dependent approach, emphasising that the pace of future monetary easing will be assessed on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Decisions will continue to depend on the evolving inflation outlook, risk balance, and incoming data.
It added that the CBE remains fully committed to achieving price stability, and “will not hesitate to use all available monetary tools” to guide inflation toward its targets of 7% (±2%) in Q4 2026 and 5% (±2%) in Q4 2028, on average.
The MPC’s latest rate cut reflects confidence in Egypt’s ongoing disinflation trend amid improving inflation expectations, stronger growth momentum, and continued stability in global prices. However, the CBE cautioned that risks remain tilted to the upside, particularly from potential regulated price adjustments and heightened geopolitical tensions, underscoring the need for vigilance as it calibrates the path of monetary easing.",711,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8450037837028503,2025-12-08T21:30:03.153894

The milestone supports the Ministry’s strategy to boost production, expand exports, enhance value added and strengthen national industries.
The shipment, valued at $2m, departed from Adabiya Port and included 20,000 tonnes of calcined petroleum coke produced from 27,000 tonnes of green petroleum coke.
The export marks the beginning of a new operational phase for the factory—located within the Ain Sokhna economic zone—following the completion of comprehensive rehabilitation and maintenance works across its production units.
Minister of Public Enterprises Sector Mohamed El-Shimy said the factory’s return to production and export reflects the state’s success in revitalising national industries and enhancing their competitiveness. He noted that the Ministry is pursuing an overarching vision to maximise the productive capacity of its affiliated companies, improve operational efficiency, increase industrial exports and deepen local content.
El-Shimy described the facility’s restart as a strategic move that restores a vital supply chain to Egyptian industry, particularly the aluminium sector, while contributing to higher exports and increased foreign currency revenues. He praised the factory’s workforce and reaffirmed the Ministry’s commitment to improving working conditions to ensure high performance and sustainable operations.
He added that reviving EgyptAnode forms part of the Ministry’s broader reform programme aimed at enabling its subsidiaries to operate as strong, competitive and sustainable industrial entities with greater contributions to the national economy.
Current operational data shows the factory is running at full capacity on its first production line, with an annual output of 130,000 tonnes. Production is expected to double to 260,000 tonnes per year in the first quarter of 2026 with the launch of the second line, raising projected annual revenues to around $25m.
In January 2025, EgyptAnode signed a five-year cooperation agreement with BP to implement rehabilitation works, enhance production and achieve the highest levels of operational efficiency—supporting the factory’s long-term competitiveness.
EgyptAnode is one of the first companies in the Middle East specialising in the calcination of green petroleum coke. It plays a key role in supplying essential raw materials to the aluminium industry and related heavy industries, relying on modern technologies and strict quality and safety standards that reinforce its position as a core pillar of national manufacturing.",401,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.92715322971344,2025-12-08T21:30:13.624763

He noted that the ministry now holds 3.5 billion electronic invoices and receipts that it aims to analyse more deeply to support the economy and improve service quality.
Kouchouk stressed that the government intends to work closely with all stakeholders to make effective use of the vast volume of data generated through automation and digital transformation. This “information wealth,” he said, represents a major opportunity for investment in AI.
Speaking at the “Future of the Accounting and Auditing Profession in Egypt in the Age of Artificial Intelligence” conference, organised by the Egyptian Society of Accountants and Auditors, the minister affirmed that artificial intelligence has the capacity to significantly boost productivity and revenues, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of public services.
He emphasised that the continuous development of the accounting and auditing profession is, in itself, a strong investment in Egypt’s broader economic competitiveness.
Kouchouk said the ministry will continue upgrading its systems to build more efficient, accessible and business-friendly tax services capable of supporting economic growth. He added that the government is closely attentive to recommendations made by accounting and auditing experts and is “highly open” to ambitious ideas, backed by incentives and institutional support.
The minister noted that the ministry aims to launch exceptional, long-term programmes for training and capacity building, in addition to expanding local and international partnerships to elevate the accounting and auditing profession.

2025-12-01,"UNCTAD warns of unprecedented economic collapse in Occupied Palestinian Territory, urges urgent reconstruction",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/01/unctad-warns-of-unprecedented-economic-collapse-in-occupied-palestinian-territory-urges-urgent-reconstruction/,"A new report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) warns that prolonged military operations and long-standing restrictions have driven the economy of the Occupied Palestinian Territory into its most severe contraction on record, erasing decades of development gains and deepening fiscal and social fragility.
The report, Developments in the Economy of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, finds that two years of military escalation and movement restrictions have triggered an unprecedented economic collapse across the Palestinian economy. This has unfolded against a backdrop of structural vulnerabilities, with far-reaching social, environmental and institutional consequences.
According to UNCTAD, extensive damage to infrastructure, productive assets and public services has reversed decades of socio-economic progress. The resulting crisis is now among the ten worst economic contractions recorded globally since 1960, while conditions in Gaza represent the most severe downturn on record.
At the same time, plummeting revenues and the withholding of fiscal transfers by the Israeli Government have severely constrained the Palestinian Government’s ability to maintain essential services or invest in recovery at a moment when large-scale spending is urgently required. The escalation has pushed the Palestinian economy from a prolonged slowdown into a near-total collapse, with repercussions across all sectors. In Gaza, the entire population has fallen into multidimensional poverty. The West Bank is experiencing its sharpest economic downturn on record, driven by heightened insecurity, increased movement restrictions and a collapse in productive activity.
By the end of 2024, Palestinian GDP had fallen back to its 2010 level, while GDP per capita returned to that of 2003—effectively wiping out 22 years of development gains in under two years.
Gaza: Economy reduced to a fraction of its former size
For nearly twenty years, 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza have lived under severe restrictions on trade, movement and access to resources within one of the world’s most densely populated areas. Limited entry of goods, restrictions on productive inputs and technology, and recurrent military operations have dismantled Gaza’s productive base, creating near-total dependence on external assistance.
In 2024 alone, Gaza’s GDP contracted by 83% compared with 2023, following a major decline the previous year. Over 2023–2024, GDP shrank cumulatively by 87% to $362m. GDP per capita fell to $161—among the lowest globally—and is now just 4.6% of the West Bank’s per capita income, down from near parity in 1994.
Destruction of infrastructure, widespread loss of productive capacity and mass displacement have caused lasting damage to human capital. Disruptions to education and basic services will have long-term consequences for livelihoods and societal resilience. Housing, utilities and essential infrastructure have been devastated, cutting off access to food, water, healthcare and public services, and creating an acute humanitarian and economic emergency.
UNCTAD warns that even with substantial international assistance, recovery to pre-October 2023 GDP levels could take decades. It stresses that ensuring the durability of the October 2025 ceasefire is essential to enable meaningful reconstruction, while humanitarian aid remains urgently needed.
West Bank: Sharpest downturn on record
Settlement expansion and movement restrictions continue to fragment the West Bank, constrain trade and investment, and reduce access to land, markets and resources for more than 3.3 million Palestinians. These constraints increase transport costs, lengthen travel times and disrupt access to employment, education and healthcare.
Since late 2023, movement restrictions have intensified further, sharply reducing economic activity. West Bank GDP contracted by 17%, while GDP per capita fell by 18.8%, returning to levels last seen in 2014 and 2008 respectively.
Fiscal pressures deepen institutional strain
The fiscal situation deteriorated markedly after October 2023, making 2024 one of the most challenging years for the Palestinian Government. Revenue shortfalls, the withholding of fiscal transfers, a contracting economy and declining external support have deepened the crisis, with pressures continuing into 2025.
Between January 2019 and April 2025, cumulative deductions and withheld fiscal transfers amounted to an estimated $1.76bn—equivalent to 12.8% of GDP in 2024 and 44% of total net revenues. Combined with a shrinking tax base and falling donor contributions, these shortfalls have severely limited the Government’s capacity to pay salaries, sustain essential functions and deliver basic services.
UNCTAD stresses that urgent and sustained international financial support is needed to stabilise public finances, safeguard institutional capacity and enable effective reconstruction.
Rebuilding Gaza requires more than $70bn
UNCTAD estimates the cost of reconstruction and recovery in Gaza at more than $70bn, underscoring the scale of investment needed to rebuild infrastructure, restore services and revive livelihoods.
The report calls for immediate and coordinated international intervention to halt the economic collapse, address the deepening humanitarian crisis and lay the foundations for sustainable peace and development. It urges a comprehensive recovery plan for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, coupled with restored fiscal transfers and measures to ease constraints on movement, trade and investment.
UNCTAD’s role
For nearly four decades, UNCTAD has provided policy research, technical cooperation and capacity-building support to the Palestinian people. Its work focuses on trade facilitation, productive capacity and institutional development, in partnership with public and private stakeholders and civil society, while also promoting international consensus on the needs of the Palestinian economy.",837,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9672011137008668,2025-12-08T21:30:21.681620

The framework, titled the “Real Estate Regulatory Unit,” aims to create a permanent system to oversee the sector, protect the rights of buyers and investors, and curb market manipulation and unregulated practices. Qoura said the plan would help stabilise the property market, improve project execution, eliminate “illusory property sales,” and position real estate as a driver of sustainable economic growth.
He stressed that the proposal’s core objective is to safeguard investors’ funds, protect buyers’ rights, and establish a fair legal structure that also supports developers and promotes overall market stability. Qoura added that, despite the sector’s strategic economic importance, particularly for Egyptians at home and abroad, as well as Arab and Gulf investors, Egypt still lacks a comprehensive law governing real estate transactions.
Under the proposal, a national real estate authority would be established to regulate the market and supervise projects. Each project would be required to operate a mandatory escrow account into which all customer payments and financing would be deposited. Disbursement to developers would be tied to verified construction progress, monitored by a general consultant and the proposed authority, to ensure timely and compliant project delivery.
The system, Qoura noted, is designed to benefit both buyers and developers. Buyers’ funds would be protected, while developers would be shielded from risks arising from unforeseen economic shocks such as currency devaluation. Compensation would be limited to actual cost differences without additional profit margins, helping ensure projects are completed even under challenging conditions.
The proposal also calls for unifying sales contracts across real estate companies, requiring standardised and transparent data on unit areas, pricing, services and facilities. This measure aims to reduce price disparities and curb unfair practices across the sector.
Drawing on international models tailored to Egypt’s market, the draft incorporates elements from the regulatory experiences of the UAE, Saudi Arabia and the United States, adapted to local circumstances.
Key features include the creation of a national coordinating body composed of representatives from the Ministries of Housing, Justice and Finance, as well as the Central Bank of Egypt, to oversee projects and regulate relationships between developers, buyers and financiers.
The plan also proposes launching a unified digital monitoring platform providing a comprehensive database of all projects, developers, actual prices and construction progress. Linked to banks, financing institutions and the New Urban Communities Authority, the platform would enhance transparency and enable real-time oversight.
To speed up dispute resolution, the proposal recommends establishing a specialised judicial unit comprising judges, legal advisers and engineering experts to handle real estate disputes efficiently, avoiding delays associated with traditional civil courts.
Additional measures include requiring developers to issue a digital unit identification certificate detailing the approved area, true price per square metre, project registration number and the project’s dedicated bank account. The draft also bans vague or misleading terminology in sales contracts.
The proposal seeks to attract foreign investment through tax and administrative incentives for environmentally compliant developers, simplified registration procedures for foreign buyers and strengthened international marketing of Egyptian real estate through embassies and diplomatic missions.
Post-delivery management is also addressed through provisions for dedicated maintenance accounts, with maintenance deposits transferred to homeowners’ associations to ensure service sustainability.
The proposal will now be examined by the relevant Senate committees before being referred to the House of Representatives and subsequently to the government for further consideration.",632,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.8861126899719238,2025-12-08T21:30:24.544949
2025-12-06,Netanyahu’s pick for Mossad chief sparks resignation threats over lack of experience,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/06/netanyahus-pick-for-mossad-chief-sparks-resignation-threats-over-lack-of-experience/,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to appoint his Military Secretary, Major General Roman Gofman, as the new head of the Mossad foreign intelligence agency has sparked a political storm and threats of mass resignations among agency officials, Israeli media reported.
Channel 13 cited current and former Mossad officials describing Gofman as a “veteran warrior” who nonetheless lacks essential experience in the world of intelligence.
“This is a severe blow to the organisation. Gofman’s appointment could put an end to the golden age of the institution,” a senior Mossad official told the channel.
Critics also pointed to a “problematic” issue in Gofman’s biography involving the employment of a teenager in an influence campaign, which reportedly resulted in the youth’s prolonged detention.
A senior security official previously described the appointment process as “delusional”, alleging that the Prime Minister’s wife, Sara Netanyahu, was unofficially involved. The official claimed she interviewed Gofman for the Military Secretary role before the proposal was submitted to the Senior Appointments Advisory Committee.
While reports suggest Netanyahu bypassed Mossad candidates he previously supported to appoint Gofman, raising concerns over his lack of intelligence background, his allies argued that his “loyalty, wisdom, and aggressive thinking suit the position”.
The Prime Minister’s office defended the choice, highlighting Gofman’s service in various operational and command roles within the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), including in the Armored Corps and as commander of the Etzion Brigade.
“Major General Roman Gofman is a multi-talented officer. His appointment as Military Secretary to the Prime Minister at the height of the War of Resurrection proved that he possesses exceptional professional capabilities,” the statement from Netanyahu’s office said, adding that Gofman maintained continuous contact with all intelligence agencies, particularly Mossad, during his tenure.
Gofman, 49, was born in Belarus and immigrated to Israel in 1990. He holds a bachelor’s degree in political science from Ashkelon Academic College and a master’s degree in political science and national security from the University of Haifa.
The appointment comes as Netanyahu’s government faces widespread internal criticism regarding the intelligence failure to predict the October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian factions on southern Israeli towns.",356,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.6197185516357422,2025-12-08T21:30:27.414148

Speaking at a weekly press conference following a cabinet meeting at the New Administrative Capital, Madbouly confirmed that the IMF mission arrived two days ago to commence the fifth and sixth reviews of the country’s loan programme. The delegation has already held initial meetings with the Minister of Finance and the Central Bank Governor.
“There is optimism that matters will proceed within a good framework in light of the positive indicators of the Egyptian economy,” Madbouly said.
He added that the country’s economic performance is tracking in line with government hopes, noting that “indeed some economic indicators have achieved better than what was targeted with the Fund.”
In a move to further stimulate the economy, Madbouly announced that President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi has approved the launch of a second package of tax facilities.
Madbouly explained that this is the second of four planned tax packages designed to improve the investment climate and support the private sector’s expansion. The first tranche was implemented last year, with the current package planned for execution this year.
Regarding structural reforms, the Prime Minister said the government is currently updating the “State Ownership Policy Document,” as the original three-year timeframe for the policy expires this December. He expects the final draft of the updated version to be ready by March, after which it will be presented for social dialogue.",256,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9120429158210754,2025-12-08T21:30:32.618664

The agreement aims to support the development of innovative green financial products and strengthen the bank’s institutional capabilities in sustainable finance.
The signing ceremony was attended by Tamer Negm, HDB’s Assistant Managing Director for Corporate Credit, Syndicated Loans, Treasury and Investment; representatives from the Frankfurt School and GIZ; as well as senior bank officials.
Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to advancing green finance solutions and institutional capacity-building in support of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Egypt’s transition toward a green economy, in line with global trends and domestic market priorities.
The partnership aligns with HDB’s strategic direction to expand innovative financing tools that embed sustainability principles across the banking sector. It also leverages the Frankfurt School’s extensive international experience in designing and implementing sustainable finance frameworks in emerging markets.
The cooperation will enable the development of a wide range of products, including green loans, sustainability-linked financing, and frameworks for green bonds and sustainable sukuk. It will also support the creation of green investment portfolios, introduce tailored financing mechanisms for SMEs operating in the green economy, develop tools to measure the environmental impact of financial products, and roll out awareness programmes to promote sustainable finance principles among clients.
Commenting on the agreement, Tamer Negm expressed his pride in the strategic partnership and praised the Frankfurt School’s global leadership in sustainable finance. He said the MoU represents a significant milestone in HDB’s expansion of sustainable financial offerings and underscores the bank’s commitment to adopting international best practices to deliver innovative products that meet the needs of the Egyptian market amid accelerating environmental and economic transitions.
Negm highlighted that Q3 2025 marked strong momentum in the bank’s sustainable finance efforts, with HDB’s sustainable finance portfolio rising to EGP 6.93bn,  a 70% increase compared to 2024. Sustainable financing now accounts for 23% of the bank’s total corporate, syndicated loan, and SME financing portfolio, up from 13% during the same period last year, reflecting clear progress in embedding sustainability across the bank’s operations.
He added that the partnership represents a major step toward institutionalising sustainability across HDB’s activities, enhancing internal capabilities, and fostering innovative financial tools that support Egypt’s national drive towards a green economy. Negm affirmed that sustainability remains a core pillar of the bank’s identity and a fundamental component of its 2025–2030 strategy.",432,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8653440475463867,2025-12-08T21:30:35.522623
2025-12-07,GAFI launches guideline for cash investment Incentive to support industrial projects,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/gafi-launches-guideline-for-cash-investment-incentive-to-support-industrial-projects/,"Hossam Heiba, CEO of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI), announced the release of the official guideline for the new cash investment incentive dedicated to industrial projects. The initiative reflects the government’s commitment to transparency, clarity, streamlined procedures, and accessible information for investors.
Heiba confirmed that the guideline is now available to all investors and can be accessed via the email link:
[email protected]
. He added that the committee responsible for administering the incentive has begun receiving applications through the same channel.
According to Heiba, the incentive represents one of the most significant mechanisms for attracting foreign direct investment, as it provides eligible investors with a direct cash payment disbursed after taxes are paid. The value of the incentive is linked to the volume of foreign financing allocated to the project, which must account for at least 50% of the project’s total capital. In addition, eligible projects must ensure that industrial products listed in the schedule attached to the Cabinet decision represent no less than 50% of their annual turnover.
GAFI previously issued Decision No. 675 of 2025 establishing the committee tasked with granting the cash investment incentive for industrial projects. The committee is chaired by a GAFI representative and includes members from the Industrial Development Authority, the Industrial Modernisation Centre, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Central Bank of Egypt, and the Egyptian Tax Authority.
The committee’s responsibilities include assessing applications, issuing decisions, granting eligibility certificates, providing annual approvals for incentive disbursement, and issuing preliminary approvals in accordance with Cabinet Decision No. 77 of 2023.
Heiba noted that, consistent with the state’s strategy to support the industrial sector, localize manufacturing, and enhance the competitiveness of Egyptian products as a driver of economic growth, Law No. 160 of 2023 was enacted to amend certain provisions of the Investment Law. The amendment added Article 11 (bis), which provides industrial investment projects with a cash incentive without affecting other incentives already granted by the law. Cabinet Decision No. 77 of 2023 further defined the requirements, controls, and criteria for implementing the incentive—from eligibility conditions and classifications to disbursement and oversight mechanisms.
The decision also allows industrial projects to obtain a preliminary approval valid for three years, giving investors added assurance that they will receive the incentive even if regulatory changes occur during the implementation period.",390,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.8345538973808289,2025-12-08T21:30:38.351023

The event is attended by governors of Arab central banks and representatives from regional and international financial institutions.
“I am honoured to participate in the current session… which serves as an annual platform for regional dialogue and cooperation on economic and monetary trends,” Abdalla said in a statement. He noted that this year’s session comes at a critical time, in light of the challenges confronting the global economy, particularly those arising from trade wars, which demand “precise and timely responses from central banks.”
Abdalla underscored that “encouraging increased domestic production and strengthening productive capacities are two core pillars in containing inflationary pressures and achieving long-term economic stability.” He affirmed the commitment of central banks to advancing their tools in line with the evolving global economic landscape, ensuring price stability while supporting economic resilience.
The ongoing session, chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank of Sudan, addresses several key topics, including the challenges central banks face in managing shocks from trade wars, frameworks to strengthen cybersecurity, and the progress of the Comprehensive Instant Digital Payments Initiative in Arab Countries.
The session will also review the outcomes of technical committees specialising in banking supervision, financial inclusion, green financing, and financial stability. A closed session is scheduled to discuss preparations for the third round of mutual evaluations and the challenges facing the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.

He highlighted that tax revenues increased by EGP 600bn during the last fiscal year without imposing any additional burdens, thanks to a confidence-based partnership framework with the business community.
Speaking at an open dialogue with students at Nile University, Kouchouk noted that the 73% jump in private investment reflects tangible economic improvement. “No one risks their money out of courtesy,” he said, describing this as a strong step toward restoring private-sector confidence and incentivising its role as the engine of economic growth.
The minister stressed that the government’s primary focus is to increase state resources to enhance citizens’ quality of life. “We need to grow revenues to improve spending on healthcare, education, and social protection,” he said.
Kouchouk also explained that Egypt’s economic and fiscal policies prioritise supporting production and exports across all sectors, including human capital. He emphasised that Egypt remains open to global investors, offering increasingly diverse and competitive economic opportunities. “The economy is in good shape, and what is coming is even better with rising private investment,” he noted.
To simplify compliance, the ministry plans to provide tax services via a dedicated mobile application and is seeking partnerships with leading artificial intelligence firms to maximise data use and improve taxpayer services.
The minister underscored the government’s readiness to support entrepreneurial ventures, pointing out that the simplified tax system offers numerous incentives for start-ups and SMEs. He also highlighted growth in the ICT sector and the state’s aim to expand digital and service exports.
Kouchouk further highlighted efforts to reduce public debt and strengthen fiscal indicators. He said Egypt successfully cut budget-sector debt by 10% over two years, while external debt fell by around $4bn. “The government remains committed to fiscal discipline while stimulating economic activity through performance-linked incentives,” he added.
Addressing the students, Kouchouk concluded: “Public service and serving your country is both an honour and a responsibility. Youth must take part in everything we do. They are the future. Never stop dreaming, work to achieve your ambitions, and we are right behind you.”",361,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9462611675262452,2025-12-08T21:30:55.089686
2025-10-19,CBE attributes inflation slowdown to easing food prices for fourth consecutive month,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/19/cbe-attributes-inflation-slowdown-to-easing-food-prices-for-fourth-consecutive-month/,"Egypt’s annual urban headline inflation declined to 11.7% in September 2025, down from 12% in August, marking the fourth consecutive month of moderation, according to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). This deceleration was primarily driven by a sharp slowdown in annual food inflation, which dropped to 1.4% in September—its lowest level since April 2021.
While food inflation eased significantly, non-food inflation remained relatively stable. It has hovered around 20.8% since the beginning of the year and recorded 19.1% in September. However, annual core inflation—which excludes volatile items such as food and energy—accelerated to 11.3% in September from 10.7% in August. This uptick was largely attributed to rising services inflation, most notably a 12% increase in rents. Monthly core inflation reached 1.5%, compared to 1.0% in the same month last year.
Monthly urban headline inflation recorded a rate of 1.8% in September 2025, slightly below the 2.1% registered in September 2024. This monthly increase was mainly driven by higher prices for fresh fruits and vegetables as well as services.
In rural areas, headline inflation also eased, falling to 8.9% in September from 10.3% in August. On a national level, annual headline inflation declined to 10.3%, compared to 11.2% the previous month.
Despite the annual slowdown in food inflation, monthly food inflation rose to 2% in September. This increase contributed 0.7% to the monthly headline inflation rate. The rise was mainly due to increases in prices of volatile food items, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. Fresh fruit prices increased by 5.6%, while fresh vegetables rose by 15.5%. Egg prices also increased by 5.7%, contributing further to the monthly rate.
Services prices climbed by 3.2% in September, contributing 0.89% to monthly headline inflation. The notable rise in rents accounted for 0.74% of this figure, alongside increased spending in restaurants and cafés.
Retail item prices rose by 0.8% during the month, contributing 0.11%. This was mainly due to higher prices of household appliances, cleaning supplies, and personal care products, in addition to seasonal increases in clothing, stationery, and school supplies associated with the start of the academic year.
Regulated prices saw a smaller increase of 0.3%, contributing 0.07% to monthly inflation. This was driven by a 0.8% rise in tobacco prices and a 1.1% increase in the price of LPG butane gas cylinders.
Monthly core inflation reflected the cumulative impact of these developments, recording 1.5% in September. The main driver was the services category, which contributed 1.2%, followed by retail items and core food, contributing 0.2% and 0.1% respectively.",416,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.7981115579605103,2025-12-08T21:31:05.302906

The increase was largely driven by higher fuel prices, following the government’s decision to raise petroleum product prices by 10.5–12.9% in October.
The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) reported that monthly core consumer price index (CPI) climbed to 2% in October 2025, compared with 1.5% in September 2025 and 1.3% in October 2024. On an annual basis, core inflation reached 12.1%, up from 11.3% the previous month.
Meanwhile, the nationwide annual inflation rate eased slightly to 10.1% in October, compared to 10.3% in September, CAPMAS said.
The CPI for the entire country reached 264.3 points in October, marking a 1.3% monthly increase. CAPMAS attributed the rise to higher costs in several key categories, particularly food, clothing, housing, and utilities.
Notable price gains were recorded in grains and bread, meat and poultry, dairy products, oils and fats, vegetables, sugar and confectionery, beverages, and tobacco. Prices of textiles, ready-made clothing, footwear, rent, and household maintenance also moved higher.
In contrast, fish and seafood prices declined by 0.3%, fruits fell by 10.6%, and audio-visual equipment, computers, and hotel services registered minor decreases.
Looking ahead, the CBE projects average annual headline inflation to ease to 14% in 2025 and 10.5% in 2026, down from 28.3% in 2024, before converging toward its medium-term target of 7% (±2%) by Q4 2026 and 5% (±2%) by Q4 2028.
At its October meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut key interest rates by one percentage point, bringing the deposit rate to 21%, the lending rate to 22%, and the main operation and discount rates to 21.5%.
The committee said the move supports the decline in inflation expectations and reinforces monetary policy consistency, while warning that inflation remains subject to upside risks, including potential administrative price adjustments and geopolitical tensions in the region.",321,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.6626359820365906,2025-12-08T21:31:26.725285

Speaking during a meeting with an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission in Cairo, Al-Mashat reported that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth reached 5.3% in the first quarter of the year, a figure she described as exceeding expectations.
The talks were held as part of the fifth and sixth reviews of Egypt’s economic reform programme.
Al-Mashat attributed the first-quarter performance to improvements in industrial production, citing increased growth rates in sectors such as vehicles, textiles, and ready-made garments. She stated this indicates a shift toward high-productivity, tradable sectors.
To maintain macroeconomic stability, the minister highlighted the government’s adherence to a public investment ceiling of EGP 1trn last fiscal year. She noted that limiting public spending had “opened the way for more private-sector investments”.
On structural reforms, Al-Mashat pointed to the establishment of a State-Owned Enterprises Unit. The unit has been granted a mandate to maximise asset value and determine the most appropriate scenarios for state-owned companies, in line with the State Ownership Policy Document aimed at empowering the private sector.
The minister also presented “Egypt’s Narrative for Economic Development,” a framework designed to transform the economic model to focus more on production and exports. She added that the ministry’s “Quarterly GDP Note” now includes data on structural reforms to improve transparency.
Regarding climate policy, Al-Mashat told the mission that two new projects had been added to the “NWFE” country platform to support the transition to renewable energy. She also outlined efforts to integrate environmental dimensions into public investment criteria to address climate risks to assets.
The ministry is currently implementing the “Adaa” system to monitor national and sectoral policies, aiming to link allocated appropriations to specific results and ensure public spending efficiency, Al-Mashat said.",316,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7812051177024841,2025-12-08T21:31:29.595883

The initiative aligns with the World Bank Group’s goal, set in April 2024, of providing essential health services to 1.5 billion people globally by 2030.
Under the compact, Egypt has outlined a five-year reform plan focusing on strengthening primary healthcare, enhancing financial protection, and supporting job-rich economic growth. Key measures include modernising healthcare facilities, expanding digital health tools, training medical professionals, and increasing insurance coverage, all aimed at improving accessibility and affordability for citizens.
The launch comes amid regional challenges such as aging populations, rising chronic diseases, and increasing financial pressures on households. Globally, 4.6 billion people lack access to essential health services, while 2.1 billion face financial hardship due to medical costs, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable health system reforms.
Egypt’s National Health Compact includes several priority initiatives. The country is expanding digitally connected health facilities to improve service delivery, strengthening the healthcare workforce through advanced training and digital tools, and reducing financial barriers by widening health insurance coverage and providing targeted support for vulnerable populations. The plan also seeks to enhance local production of health technologies and pharmaceuticals through investment in training and the establishment of specialised Centres of Excellence.
The World Bank Group, Gavi, the Global Fund, and philanthropic partners are supporting Egypt and other compact countries with aligned financing, technical assistance, and capacity-building to ensure effective implementation of reforms.
Egypt’s participation in the National Health Compact reflects the government’s commitment to building a more resilient and equitable health system, while generating economic opportunities through healthcare expansion.",279,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7007718682289124,2025-12-08T21:31:34.812762
2025-12-07,"Amazon Egypt expands storage capacity amid rising demand, local manufacturing boom",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/amazon-egypt-expands-storage-capacity-amid-rising-demand-local-manufacturing-boom/,"Egypt has endured one of the most challenging economic periods in its recent history over the past two years. Surging inflation and sharp exchange-rate volatility have reshaped consumer behaviour, pushing households to prioritise essential goods over discretionary spending. According to Omar Elsahy, General Manager of Amazon Egypt, this shift has been clearly reflected in purchasing trends on Amazon.eg.
“Demand for essential goods, particularly food items and basic household products, has grown tremendously,” Elsahy told Daily News Egypt. “Our priority was to strengthen our presence in these categories to ensure that Egyptian families could access the essentials they rely on every day.”
At the same time, he noted, an unexpected trend has taken hold: a significant rise in the availability and quality of locally manufactured products. Egyptian factories and artisans have increased production across sectors such as apparel, home goods and personal accessories, offering high-quality items at more accessible prices.
“The rise of local manufacturing has been transformative for Egyptian e-commerce,” Elsahy said. “Customers are increasingly choosing local products not just for price, but for quality and uniqueness. Supporting these entrepreneurs is part of Amazon’s DNA, hence our dedicated storefronts and programmes for Egyptian SMEs. When local sellers succeed, customers get better selection, communities flourish, and the digital economy grows stronger. Despite economic challenges, this vibrant seller community has contributed significantly to e-commerce growth over the past three years.”
Elsahy revealed that Amazon’s storage footprint in Egypt has now expanded to more than 100,000 cubic metres. “This includes our main fulfilment centres in 10th of Ramadan and on the Suez Road, supported by several additional operational sites run through local partners.”
One of the newest facilities, he added, offers storage capacity equivalent to ten football fields, underlining Amazon’s long-term investment in Egypt’s digital infrastructure. “These expansions are not a temporary reaction to rising demand. They are part of a forward-looking strategy to prepare for the next three years of growth.”
Much of this strategy is rooted in Egypt’s progress in financial inclusion, logistics development and its advancing digital economy, all critical to enabling faster, more reliable e-commerce operations.
Since Amazon launched in Egypt in 2021, collaboration with government authorities has intensified. Elsahy described it as a “shared vision” aimed at strengthening the digital economy and empowering local manufacturers and sellers.
He noted that the Prime Minister’s meeting with Amazon’s global CEO in April served as a progress review to ensure that expansion plans align with the government’s digital-transformation and financial-inclusion agenda. “Government support has been crucial,” he said. “It facilitated licensing, enhanced the regulatory environment and enabled smoother business operations.”
Amazon has also broadened cooperation with chambers of commerce and SME-support programmes, integrating hundreds of factories and companies into its seller network. As a result, more Egyptian products are reaching wider audiences on Amazon.eg.
Financial solutions have become an increasingly important part of Amazon’s customer offering in Egypt. The company has expanded payment options through strategic partnerships with financial-service providers including Valu and several banks.
“Egyptian customers are looking for flexibility in how they pay, particularly for higher-value purchases,” Elsahy explained. “Our collaborations allow customers to spread payments over time, making more products accessible to more people.” These partnerships have introduced innovative tools, especially during major sale events such as the White Friday Sale—including 0% interest instalments, buy-now-pay-later options and exclusive discounts for specific bank cards.
“Every investment decision we make centres on customer needs,” he emphasised. “We continuously evaluate these collaborations to ensure they help customers get what they need, when they need it, at prices they can afford. That is the lens through which we view all our business decisions.”
Addressing speculation about robots, drones and other futuristic technologies, Elsahy clarified that most of Amazon’s innovation happens behind the scenes. Visible tools—such as warehouse robots or drone delivery—are not what ultimately define service quality. “What truly elevates the customer experience is faster fulfilment, higher accuracy and better availability.”
Despite economic volatility, Elsahy remains optimistic. “Egypt has tremendous potential, with strong customer demand across many categories. We grow thoughtfully, but never before we are ready to deliver a great customer experience.” His closing message reflects Amazon’s global philosophy: “Every decision begins with one question, does it serve the customer? If the answer is yes, we move. If not, we wait.”",710,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.912598192691803,2025-12-08T21:31:37.684762
2025-10-14,Egypt’s Al-Mashat expects 2026 to be ‘turning point’ for economy after Gaza deal,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/14/egypts-al-mashat-expects-2026-to-be-turning-point-for-economy-after-gaza-deal/,"Egypt’s Minister of Planning and International Cooperation said she expects 2026 to be a “turning point” for the country’s economy, with a peace deal in Gaza set to restore normal navigation in the Suez Canal and boost revenues alongside growth in industry and tourism.
Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg after the Sharm El-Sheikh peace summit, Minister of Planning Rania Al-Mashat said a sustainable settlement would be “very positive” for both Egypt and the cost of global trade.
“It is a very important day, not just for the region but for the entire world,” Al-Mashat said of the summit. “We know that the Palestinian people have suffered for two years, so reaching a resolution and laying the foundations for peace will be essential for the future of the region.”
Al-Mashat also said that President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi had a “decisive and clear vision” for achieving peace in Gaza from the beginning of the conflict, based on a full commitment to the rights of the Palestinian people.
She highlighted that Egypt had dealt flexibly with the decrease in Suez Canal traffic caused by regional tensions by implementing necessary economic reforms since March 2024. These reforms, including fiscal consolidation, a flexible exchange rate, and a ceiling on public investments, contributed to GDP growth reaching 4.4% by the end of June and 5% in the last quarter, she said.
“If we look at the structure of growth in Egypt, we find that its sources come from increased manufacturing activity, benefiting from the reforms implemented in March 2024,” Al-Mashat said, adding that the country is continuing an ambitious structural reform programme to increase competitiveness and foster private sector participation.
She pointed to recent strong investment flows, especially in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, as favourable opportunities for the Egyptian economy to increase production and exports.
Al-Mashat added that during the upcoming annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, Egypt will present its economic reform story and highlight the continuation of positive momentum following the historic summit.
She also noted that a recent credit rating upgrade by Standard & Poor’s is proof that the reforms are moving in the right direction. “We are committed to them, and we are working to open the economy further, increase competition, and overcome the challenges we faced during the past years,” she said.",389,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9381394982337952,2025-12-08T21:31:48.102859

Nationwide inflation also decelerated, falling to 11.2% from 13.1% over the same period.
The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) reported that monthly core inflation—which excludes volatile items such as food and energy—rose by just 0.1% in August, down from 0.9% in August 2024 and recovering from a negative 0.3% in July 2025. On an annual basis, core inflation dropped to 10.7% in August from 11.6% the previous month.
The CBE forecasts that headline inflation will average between 14 and 15% for the full year, in line with its decline to 15.2% in the second quarter of 2025, down from 16.5% in the first quarter.
In light of the easing inflationary trend, the CBE’s Monetary Policy Committee decided on 28 August to cut key interest rates by 200 basis points. The overnight deposit rate now stands at 22%, the overnight lending rate at 23%, and both the credit and discount rate and the main operation rate at 22.5%.
According to the committee, the decision reflects its assessment of recent inflation developments and projections since its last meeting on 10 July. The CBE stated that demand-side inflationary pressures are expected to remain limited, supported by tight monetary policy and consistent with the short-term downward trend in inflation.
The bank reiterated its commitment to returning inflation to its target range of 7% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2026, and further to 5% (±2%) by the fourth quarter of 2028. However, it warned that inflation remains subject to upside risks, including changes in administratively set prices and rising geopolitical tensions in the region.
The CBE noted that the interest rate cut is consistent with maintaining a policy stance that anchors expectations and supports the anticipated disinflation path. It emphasized that the pace of monetary easing will be determined on a meeting-by-meeting basis, based on updated forecasts, economic data, and associated risks. The bank added that it will continue to closely monitor economic and financial conditions and use all available tools to ensure price stability and guide inflation toward its medium-term targets.",365,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9423425197601318,2025-12-08T21:31:59.571455
2025-12-07,Egypt launches initiative to transform petroleum waste into value-added resources,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/07/egypt-launches-initiative-to-transform-petroleum-waste-into-value-added-resources/,"Egypt’s Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy, Mahmoud Esmat, and Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Karim Badawi, witnessed on Sunday the signing of a cooperation protocol aimed at transforming petroleum-sector waste into value-added resources. The signing took place at the Electricity Ministry’s headquarters in the New Capital.
The agreement forms part of a broader state strategy to strengthen coordination between key authorities and ensure the efficient management of natural resources in a way that maximises economic returns.
The protocol, signed between the Nuclear Materials Authority and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), covers the treatment of technically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material (TE-NORM) generated by petroleum activities. It aims to ensure safe handling, treatment, and disposal in line with national and international environmental and health standards.
The agreement was signed by Hamed Meira, Chair of the Nuclear Materials Authority, on behalf of the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy, and Salah El-Din Abdelkarim, EGPC CEO, representing the Ministry of Petroleum.
Under the protocol, the Nuclear Materials Authority will be responsible for the treatment of petroleum waste including sediments, produced water, sludge, and other by-products—whether currently accumulated at sector sites or generated in the future. The Authority will conduct surveys and environmental assessments, prepare safe disposal and treatment plans, apply best-available technologies, and issue regular progress reports.
EGPC, meanwhile, will identify waste sites, types, and quantities, prepare technical reports, provide samples for analysis, and offer technical and logistical support to facilitate field surveys and assessments.
The cooperation supports the two ministries’ joint work plan to maximise returns from raw materials and extract valuable elements, especially rare minerals.
Esmat highlighted ongoing efforts to enhance the value of Egypt’s natural resources and the presidential directives to accelerate their optimal utilisation. He underscored the importance of providing the necessary technical capabilities and adhering to licensing, monitoring, and safety standards, alongside establishing joint technical committees to oversee implementation.
For his part, Badawi described the protocol as a strong model of integration between the petroleum and electricity sectors. He stressed that the petroleum sector’s expanding activities must go hand-in-hand with environmental protection, consistent with the ministry’s strategy that prioritises safety, emissions reduction, and sustainable resource management.
He added that proper waste treatment and recycling help transform waste into economic opportunities while advancing the environmental sustainability of petroleum and mining operations.",385,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.619785726070404,2025-12-08T21:32:04.839255

Hossam Heiba, CEO of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI), made the comments during the main session of the Egypt-Gulf Trade and Investment Forum in Cairo.
“The government aims for Egypt to be a regional centre in specific sectors where it has a high competitive advantage, primarily energy, tourism, and industry,” Heiba said. “GAFI has prepared its promotional plan to contribute to achieving these goals, and we have succeeded in attracting Arab and foreign investments in these sectors.”
Heiba reviewed the legislative and procedural amendments launched by the government to improve the investment environment since the 2017 investment law. He noted that GAFI has moved to the electronic establishment of companies and the digitalisation of services provided to investors.
“The successful Arab investor in Egypt is the most important element of promotion for the Egyptian economy, so the expansions of current investors receive the same incentives granted to new investments,” he added.

After months of slowing inflation and signs of macroeconomic stability, there is now a near-consensus among experts and investment banks that the CBE will reduce its key policy rates by between 1% and 2%.

Global context
Looking ahead
The upcoming decision comes at a critical juncture for Egypt’s economy. Policymakers are seeking to sustain the progress achieved in curbing inflation while simultaneously laying the groundwork for stronger private sector activity, investment inflows, and growth momentum. The debate now centres not on whether rates will be cut, but by how much — and how rapidly the easing cycle will unfold in the months ahead.
At its last meeting on 10 July, the MPC opted to keep its key rates unchanged: 24% for overnight deposits, 25% for overnight lending, and 24.5% for both the credit and discount rate and the main operation rate. That pause followed two successive rate cuts earlier in the year: a 225-basis-point reduction on 17 April and a further 100 basis points on 22 May.
In its July communiqué, the Committee explained that maintaining rates was “preferable” in order to allow time to assess the effects of new fiscal measures — including amendments to the value-added tax law and changes in administered prices — on inflationary dynamics. The MPC underscored that its decisions would continue to be data-dependent and conditional on the inflation outlook, potential risks, and external developments.
Inflation picture: A steady decline
Latest figures suggest that inflationary pressures have been easing consistently since the start of the year.
Core inflation
, as measured by the CBE, stood at 11.6% in July, up slightly from 11.4% in June but still well below last year’s peaks. On a monthly basis, core consumer prices actually declined by 0.3% in July, compared to a 0.2% decline in June.
Urban headline inflation
, published by CAPMAS, fell to 13.9% in July from 14.9% in June. The monthly urban CPI contracted by 0.5% in July after a 0.1% drop in June — further evidence that disinflationary forces are gaining strength.
The CBE projects that annual headline inflation will remain broadly stable at current levels for the rest of 2025 before resuming a gradual decline in 2026, converging towards the medium-term target of 7% (±2%) on average in Q4 2026. Much of this trajectory hinges on the impact of non-food price adjustments, global commodity trends, and fiscal consolidation measures.
Mohamed Abdel Aal
Expert views: Divided between 1% and 2% cuts
Banking veteran Mohamed Abdel Aal expects the MPC to opt for a 200-basis-point cut, resuming the easing cycle after July’s pause.
“Both headline and core inflation have now stabilised — at 13.9% and 11.6% respectively — largely due to lower food and beverage prices, which offset pressures from non-food inflation linked to administered price adjustments,” he said.
According to Abdel Aal, external disinflationary forces are reinforcing the trend. “Global declines in raw materials and imported goods prices are cushioning the domestic impact of subsidy rationalisation and higher VAT. This will likely allow inflation to continue falling through year-end.”
He argued that the CBE now has space to reduce rates without jeopardising stability:
Macroeconomic indicators remain broadly stable.
Global geopolitical tensions have eased somewhat.
Real interest rates have widened to levels that risk stifling private sector recovery.
“By year-end, I expect a total of 400 basis points in cumulative cuts, bringing the key rate closer to 20%,” Abdel Aal said. “A 200-basis-point cut would send the right signal.”
Still, he cautioned that the MPC could decide to remain conservative, particularly if it wishes to gauge the effects of customs duties or renewed regional instability.
Furthermore, HC Securities’ research team also forecasts a 2% cut, pointing to improved external indicators.
Macroeconomic analyst Heba Mounir highlighted several stabilising factors:
The Egyptian pound has appreciated around 5% year-to-date.
Egypt’s one-year credit default swap (CDS) spread has narrowed, signalling reduced sovereign risk.
Workers’ remittances have increased, bolstering FX inflows.
Net international reserves have expanded, providing a stronger buffer.
The banking system’s net foreign asset position has improved.
In parallel, Egypt’s domestic debt market continues to attract foreign participation. The latest 12-month Treasury bill auction cleared at 26.08%, equivalent to a positive real yield of 6.66% (after tax, based on HC’s inflation estimate).
“Despite expectations of rising energy costs, the MPC has room to cut rates by 200 basis points,” Mounir argued. “Slowing inflation, stronger external accounts, and the appreciation of the pound all strengthen the case.”
In contrast, banking analyst Shaimaa Wagih believes the MPC will prefer a more measured approach — a 100-basis-point cut.
“The CBE must strike a delicate balance: supporting growth while ensuring financial stability,” she said. “Inflation has slowed, but risks remain from Egypt’s foreign currency financing needs and potential capital outflows if yields fall too quickly.”
She noted that:
A gradual 1% cut would help ease borrowing costs for businesses and households without creating undue pressure on the pound.
Cheaper credit would boost investment, lending, and liquidity in the stock market.
The government would benefit from lower debt servicing costs, freeing fiscal space for social and developmental spending.
However, she cautioned that overly aggressive cuts could deter foreign investors in Treasury bills and bonds. “Capital flows need close monitoring,” she stressed. “A cautious pace avoids the risk of inflationary rebound.”
For Wagih, the most “professional” scenario is therefore a modest 100-basis-point cut that signals commitment to easing without triggering instability.

Market surveys: Consensus on cuts
Two major international surveys reinforce expectations of a rate reduction:
A
Reuters poll
of economists found consensus around a 100-basis-point cut at Thursday’s meeting, aimed at supporting growth amid declining inflation.
A
Bloomberg survey
of eight investment banks reached a similar conclusion, with most forecasting at least a 100-basis-point cut. Only two institutions anticipated rates remaining unchanged.
Among the banks participating in the surveys were EFG Holding, Naeem, Zeila Capital, CI Capital, Ahli Pharos, Prime, Mubasher Financial Services, Thndr, Cairo Capital, and Arabia Online.

Implications for the economy
1. Private sector revival
Lower interest rates would reduce financing costs for businesses, encouraging investment and expansion. This is particularly important for Egypt’s manufacturing and SME sectors, which have been squeezed by years of tight monetary conditions.
2. Banking sector dynamics
While banks could face narrower margins on interest spreads, this may be offset by stronger lending volumes. Retail credit — from mortgages to consumer loans — is likely to benefit, while corporate borrowing could regain momentum.
3. Capital markets boost
The stock market could see renewed liquidity as investors rebalance portfolios away from short-term debt instruments. Historically, rate cuts have been accompanied by rallies in equities, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and banking.
4. Fiscal relief
Lower rates would ease the government’s debt servicing burden. With debt costs consuming a significant portion of expenditure, even a modest reduction could free resources for public investment, infrastructure, and social protection.
5. Risks to manage
The main risks lie in external financing and the pound’s stability. A sudden outflow of foreign portfolio investment or a spike in energy import costs could put pressure on the exchange rate. This explains why some analysts favour gradualism over aggressive cuts.
Global context
Egypt’s anticipated move comes amid a broader shift in emerging markets, where central banks are cautiously unwinding the steep hikes of the past two years. Brazil, Chile, and Hungary have all entered easing cycles, while Turkey and South Africa are expected to follow suit in late 2025.
At the same time, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have signalled that their tightening cycles are over, with markets pricing in potential rate cuts in early 2026. This global backdrop provides the CBE with some room to manoeuvre, as capital flows into emerging markets remain supportive.
Looking ahead
MPC decision will likely set the tone for monetary policy in the final quarter of 2025. If the CBE opts for a bolder 200-basis-point cut, it could signal an acceleration of the easing cycle. A more cautious 100-basis-point move, however, would suggest gradualism and careful calibration.
Either way, analysts agree that the trajectory is downward, with policy rates expected to decline by at least 300–400 basis points by year-end — provided inflation remains on its current disinflationary path.
The balancing act for Egypt’s policymakers is clear: continue to anchor inflation expectations while providing breathing space for the private sector and supporting growth. The choice between a 1% or 2% cut may be tactical — but the direction of travel is unmistakable.",1494,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.8442087173461914,2025-12-08T21:32:15.464469

These include a high-tech medical equipment financing product with flexible repayment plans suited to the operational dynamics of healthcare institutions, as well as dedicated financing programmes enabling doctors and pharmacists to establish or expand specialised clinics and medical centres. The bank will also introduce green financing bundles to support energy-efficiency initiatives and sustainable operations within healthcare facilities.
Kashmiry made her remarks during her participation in the second annual Healthcare Investment Summit, attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health and Population Khaled Abdel Ghaffar; Minister of Finance Ahmed Kouchouk; and Ghada Tawfik, Assistant Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt for Corporate Social Responsibility.
The summit addressed a wide range of themes, including government efforts to stimulate investment in healthcare services; emerging opportunities for investors amid economic recovery and state-led incentives; and the localisation of medical industries supported by exchange-rate stability. Discussions also covered mechanisms for enhancing healthcare capacity to meet rising demand while managing cost and pricing pressures, as well as pathways for strengthened cooperation among the public, private and banking sectors to elevate service quality nationwide. The event further examined the growing role of banks and financial institutions in delivering products that support the expansion and accessibility of healthcare services and drive investment in this high-potential sector.
Kashmiry emphasised that healthcare and medical services financing sits at the core of United Bank’s strategy to support sustainable economic and social development. This includes financing hospital expansions, specialised medical centres, diagnostic laboratories and pharmacies, through tailored solutions for SMEs and retail financing programmes designed Specifically for doctors and pharmacists. She also highlighted the bank’s support for medical technology companies, a segment that has seen significant growth over the past three years amid rising demand for expansion, modernisation and digital transformation across the sector.
She explained that United Bank’s healthcare financing strategy is built around three pillars: supporting the expansion and development of hospitals and medical centres—particularly in governorates with limited specialised services; advancing digital health transformation; and empowering medical professionals and healthcare entrepreneurs through customised SME financing programmes covering medical equipment, laboratories and pharmaceutical services.

2025-11-01,CBE projects inflation to average 10.5% in 2026 as economic recovery gains momentum,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/01/cbe-projects-inflation-to-average-10-5-in-2026-as-economic-recovery-gains-momentum/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has projected a continued decline in inflation over the next two years, with annual headline inflation expected to average 14.0% in 2025 and 10.5% in 2026, compared to 28.3% in 2024. The Bank anticipates inflation will gradually converge towards its target of 7% (±2%) on average by the fourth quarter of 2026, signalling steady progress toward price stability following two years of inflationary pressures.
In its Q3 2025 Monetary Policy Report, the CBE emphasised that while the disinflation trend remains broadly intact, it continues to face upside risks from both domestic and global fronts. These include a higher-than-expected passthrough from fiscal consolidation measures, global commodity price volatility, and potential geopolitical flare-ups that could disrupt trade and energy markets.
Monetary Policy Report: Anchoring Transparency and Expectations
The CBE’s latest report underscores its ongoing efforts to enhance monetary policy transparency and strengthen public confidence in its inflation-targeting framework. It presents a detailed analysis of global and domestic developments, shedding light on inflation dynamics, growth trends, and financial conditions shaping the Egyptian economy in the third quarter of 2025.
The report also provides an outlook section offering a forward-looking assessment of headline inflation and real economic activity. This analysis is supported by an evaluation of the prevailing balance of risks, ensuring a data-driven approach to policymaking and market guidance.
Additionally, the report includes three thematic boxes highlighting critical aspects of monetary policy conduct:
The Basic Institutional Design of an Inflation Targeting Regime, exploring the structural underpinnings of Egypt’s transition toward a full-fledged framework.
Headline vs. Core Inflation, analysing the interplay between the two indicators and their implications for policy calibration.
Economic Activity and Employment: Does Okun’s Law Hold for Egypt?, which examines the empirical relationship between output and employment in the Egyptian context.
Economic Outlook: Growth Gathers Pace
Real GDP growth is expected to strengthen in the coming fiscal years, with projections of 4.8% in FY 2025/26 and 5.1% in FY 2026/27, according to the CBE. This acceleration will be driven primarily by robust performance in key sectors such as manufacturing, extractions, and services, alongside progress in monetary easing that is expected to bolster real private-sector credit growth.
The forecast also factors in a gradual recovery in Suez Canal revenues, underpinned by the expected normalisation of maritime activity in the Red Sea following the recent Gaza armistice. The CBE projects that the output gap will continue to narrow over the forecast horizon, with overall output levels approaching their potential by the end of FY 2025/26 — an indicator of a healthier, more balanced economy.
Global Developments: Moderating Inflation and Renewed Capital Flows
Globally, economic growth continued to recover in the second quarter of 2025 and is anticipated to maintain its momentum in the third quarter, albeit at a slower pace. This expansion is largely driven by emerging market economies, while developed markets exhibit moderate growth amid cautious monetary easing.
Global inflation has been moderating steadily, approaching central banks’ target ranges as commodity prices—particularly energy and food—have continued to ease. Energy prices stabilised, while international food prices declined for the fourth consecutive month through September 2025.
Improving inflation dynamics prompted central banks in both advanced and emerging economies to cautiously advance their monetary easing cycles, leading to more accommodative global financial conditions. This shift has resulted in a notable increase in capital inflows to emerging markets, including Egypt, where investor sentiment has been further reinforced by improving macroeconomic fundamentals and progress on structural reforms.
Egypt’s Sovereign Rating Upgraded by S&P
In a significant vote of confidence, S&P Global Ratings upgraded Egypt’s long-term sovereign credit rating from ‘B-’ to ‘B’ in October 2025, reflecting enhanced confidence in the country’s economic outlook. The upgrade was supported by the continued implementation of reform measures, stronger real growth, and improving external sector indicators, including rising reserves and healthier balance-of-payments dynamics.
The agency also noted Egypt’s commitment to fiscal discipline and the CBE’s effective inflation management, which together contribute to a more sustainable macroeconomic trajectory. The rating upgrade is expected to further reduce Egypt’s borrowing costs in international markets and enhance its attractiveness to portfolio and direct investors.
Domestic Developments: Inflation Eases and Growth Broadens
Domestically, the inflation outlook has shown clear signs of improvement. Annual headline inflation decelerated to an average of 12.5% in Q3 2025, compared to 15.2% in Q2, driven largely by a pronounced decline in food inflation, which has now reverted to pre-2022 levels.
Core inflation also moderated to 11.2%, down from 11.6% in the previous quarter, reflecting lower cost pressures and an easing in supply chain disruptions. Nonetheless, non-food inflation remained relatively persistent, fuelled by higher service costs—particularly rents—and moderate adjustments in administered prices.
The CBE’s nowcast for Q3 2025 signals a continued recovery in economic activity, with quarterly growth expected to hover around 5%. Key growth drivers include non-petroleum manufacturing, tourism, and the Suez Canal, which have all shown robust post-crisis recoveries.
Real Sector Performance and Demand Dynamics
Egypt’s real GDP at market prices expanded by 5.0% in Q2 2025, marking the fastest growth since early 2022. This strong performance lifted FY 2024/25 growth to 4.4%, up sharply from 2.4% in the previous year.
The rebound was primarily fuelled by higher private consumption and gross domestic investment, particularly in construction, manufacturing, and technology-driven sectors. The CBE expects demand-side inflationary pressures to remain contained, supported by the prevailing monetary policy stance and the projected path of the output gap.
Labour Market Trends and Wage Developments
In the labour market, real wages recorded positive growth for the fourth consecutive quarter during Q2 2025. While this improvement reflects a gradual recovery in household purchasing power, wage levels remain below their 2022 averages, suggesting limited inflationary pressure from the wage channel. Employment growth was strongest in manufacturing, logistics, and tourism—sectors that have benefited most from renewed investment and demand recovery.
External Sector: Current Account Improves and Reserves Strengthen
The current account deficit narrowed by 41% year-on-year in Q2 2025, driven by sustained increases in workers’ remittances, tourism receipts, and transport revenues, particularly from the Suez Canal. However, this improvement was partly offset by a wider hydrocarbon trade deficit, due to higher natural gas imports to meet local consumption needs.
Meanwhile, the financial account surplus remained robust, underpinned by continued foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows sufficient to cover the current account deficit. Consequently, Egypt’s overall balance of payments registered only a marginal deficit of $0.2bn in Q2 2025—a marked improvement over previous quarters.
On the monetary front, M2 money supply growth continued to slow, averaging 22.6% in Q3 2025, compared to 24.2% in Q2, reflecting tighter liquidity management and declining inflation expectations.
Monetary and Financial Conditions
The CBE reported a substantial improvement in net foreign assets (NFAs) within the banking system, which increased by $3bn between June and August 2025 to reach $17.9bn. This gain was primarily driven by commercial banks’ improved foreign exchange positions, sustained remittance inflows, and renewed portfolio investments.
Private-sector credit also expanded strongly, with local currency loans growing by 14.5% in Q3 2025, up from 12.6% in the previous quarter. The expansion reflects stronger credit demand and improving business confidence, supported by the CBE’s gradual monetary easing cycle, which saw cumulative policy rate cuts of 625 basis points in 2025.
The Bank noted that approximately 97% of policy rate cuts were transmitted to the interbank market, where the overnight rate averaged 23.6% in Q3 2025, down from 27.5% in Q1, confirming effective policy transmission.
Financial Markets and Sovereign Yields
Egyptian Eurobond yields declined by an average of 66 basis points in Q3 2025, continuing their downward trajectory since the start of FY 2024/25. This reflects more accommodative global financial conditions, declining sovereign risk, and a more sustainable macroeconomic position.
Improved investor confidence, combined with the sovereign rating upgrade and stronger fundamentals, is expected to further ease external financing pressures and support capital inflows into Egypt’s debt and equity markets over the medium term.
Optimistic outlook
The CBE’s latest projections signal a cautiously optimistic outlook for Egypt’s economy. With inflation on a downward path, growth gaining momentum, and external accounts improving, macroeconomic stability appears to be gradually taking hold.
Nevertheless, the Bank emphasises that continued structural reforms, fiscal discipline, and geopolitical stability will be essential to sustain this progress and reinforce resilience against external shocks.
If current trends persist, 2026 could mark a turning point for Egypt—ushering in a new phase of stable growth, anchored inflation, and renewed investor confidence in the country’s long-term prospects.",1406,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.7168768644332886,2025-12-08T21:32:21.152146
2025-11-22,Inflation-related risks necessitate cautious monetary-easing approach: CBE,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/11/22/inflation-related-risks-necessitate-cautious-monetary-easing-approach-cbe/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has cautioned that persistent inflation-related risks necessitate a prudent approach to the ongoing monetary easing cycle.
During its meeting last Thursday, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the CBE’s key policy rates unchanged — maintaining the overnight deposit rate at 21%, the overnight lending rate at 22%, and both the main operation rate and the credit and discount rate at 21.5%. These rates represent the main benchmark for short-term interest movements on the Egyptian pound.
The decision was widely anticipated by economists and investment banks.
So far this year, the CBE has cut interest rates by a cumulative 6.25%, with reductions of 2.25% in April, 1% in May, 2% in August and 1% in October.
In its accompanying statement, the MPC said the decision reflects its assessment of the latest inflation data and expectations since its previous meeting.
Globally, the Committee noted that indicators point to a continued recovery in economic activity, although global forecasts remain clouded by uncertainty over trade policies and persistent geopolitical tensions. Against this backdrop, central banks in advanced and emerging economies have generally taken a cautious stance in easing monetary policy.
On commodity markets, it said oil prices have been broadly stable, while many agricultural commodity prices have retreated. Nonetheless, upside risks to inflation remain, particularly the possibility of renewed disruptions to global supply chains.
Domestically, the MPC said the CBE’s estimates point to a slight improvement in economic growth, with real GDP expanding by 5.2% in the third quarter (Q3) 2025 compared with 5.0% in Q2. This acceleration was supported by strong performance in non-oil manufacturing, trade and tourism. The Committee added that output is expected to continue approaching full capacity, which is anticipated to be reached by the end of fiscal year 2025/2026.
Unemployment rose marginally to 6.4% in Q3 2025, from 6.1% in the previous quarter.
Regarding inflation, the MPC reported that the annual headline inflation rate increased to 12.5% in October 2025 from 11.7% in September. Core inflation also rose, reaching 12.1% in October compared with 11.3% a month earlier. It added that monthly inflation deviated from its typical seasonal pattern due to higher non-food prices — particularly services — which offset the impact of slowing food inflation.
The Committee stressed that further moderation in monthly inflation dynamics is needed for headline inflation to converge toward the CBE’s target.
It added that inflation expectations remain exposed to both global and domestic upside risks, including any escalation in geopolitical tensions, the persistence of services inflation, and fiscal consolidation measures that may exceed earlier projections.
Given these risks, the MPC said it must closely monitor inflation developments and their implications for the outlook, underscoring the need for caution in the monetary easing cycle.
The Committee said it therefore opted for a wait-and-see approach by holding policy rates steady, viewing this stance as appropriate for containing inflationary pressures, anchoring expectations and returning inflation to its downward path.
It reiterated that it will continue to assess its policy decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis, guided by expectations, risk assessments and incoming data. The CBE added that it stands ready to deploy all available tools to achieve price stability and steer inflation toward its target of 7% (± 2%) on average in Q4 2026.",545,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8376665115356445,2025-12-08T21:32:24.060417

Speaking at a meeting with the American Chamber of Commerce on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings in Washington, D.C., Kouchouk said Egypt’s economy is growing steadily and encouragingly, supported by a strong, diverse, and dynamic private sector operating within a more competitive business environment.
He highlighted the government’s ongoing economic and fiscal reforms, along with tax and customs facilitation measures designed to attract further private investment.
“We are continuing along a path of trust and partnership with the business community through pragmatic and flexible approaches to tax challenges,” Kouchouk said. “Our commitment is to drive growth through a more inclusive and sustainable vision, centred on a healthy, private sector–led economy focused on manufacturing and exports.”
The minister noted that preliminary indicators for the first quarter of the current fiscal year point to balanced and stable financial performance, with a primary surplus exceeding EGP 170 billion, declining government debt, and strong growth in tax revenues — driven by an expanded tax base and improved relations with taxpayers.
Kouchouk emphasised that Egypt’s reform programme continues to progress positively, reflected in improved perceptions among investors, markets, and international rating agencies. He said Egypt has also shared details of its recent fiscal and structural reforms with the IMF, demonstrating the success of the previous fiscal year’s outcomes.
He revealed that Egypt’s privatisation and public offering programme will, for the first time, open new sectors to private and foreign investors — including airports, insurance, and telecommunications. The government is also assessing financial and non-financial incentives to encourage companies to list on the Egyptian Exchange (EGX) and increase trading volumes, he added, noting that the Egyptian market has the capacity to attract hundreds of new private firms with strong investment returns.
Addressing the role of technology, Kouchouk underscored the transformative impact of electronic tax systems in simplifying compliance and expanding the taxpayer base. “Automation has enabled us to build a more transparent, trustworthy, and predictable relationship with the tax community,” he said during a panel discussion on digital transformation in tax administration held as part of the IMF and World Bank meetings.
He added that digitising and streamlining procedures reduces the cost of voluntary compliance and attracts new taxpayers, while ensuring technological solutions are effectively employed to enhance services and protect taxpayer rights.
Kouchouk also highlighted the ministry’s efforts to develop skilled human capital capable of managing advanced digital systems, alongside establishing continuous communication channels with the tax community to explain ongoing reforms and their long-term benefits.",440,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9441251754760742,2025-12-08T21:32:28.004195

Speaking at the third annual conference of the Regional Network in Energy for Women in the Middle East and North Africa (RENEW MENA), Al-Mashat stated that the presence of women in energy is valuable precisely because the sector has historically been male-dominated.
“The country’s largest mine is currently managed by a woman, which reflects the reality we witness daily: women are capable, qualified, and effective in every sector,” Al-Mashat said.
The minister noted that massive electrical interconnection projects—linking Egypt with Jordan and Saudi Arabia—are not only enhancing energy security but creating employment, with a significant number of women included in the teams managing these operations.
Al-Mashat said the transition to renewable energy, such as wind and solar, is critical for producing efficient, low-cost power while opening new horizons for jobs requiring “green skills”.
To support this shift, Egypt has launched a “National Narrative for Economic Development” to integrate policies and enhance labour market flexibility. Al-Mashat added that a new labour law includes specific elements to address obstacles hindering women’s participation, ensuring their professional rights and regulating the work environment.
“Development cannot be achieved without skilled cadres,” Al-Mashat said. She emphasised the importance of gender-responsive public spending and financial tools, such as green bonds and sustainable development goal (SDG) bonds, to fund activities that elevate women’s presence in the economy.
Organised by the World Bank, the conference included participation from Stephane Guimbert, the bank’s Country Director for Egypt, Yemen, and Djibouti, and Anna Bjerde, World Bank Managing Director of Operations.
RENEW MENA, supported by the World Bank and the Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP), functions as a platform to accelerate gender equality in the energy sector, involving over 60 partners from public institutions, private companies, and academia.",325,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.6657184958457947,2025-12-10T09:27:27.263291

Speaking during a panel discussion in Saudi Arabia, El-Khatib stated that Egypt is currently working to raise the level of private sector involvement in energy production and associated industries to support economic growth and sustainable development.
The development of data centres and artificial intelligence represents a joint strategic direction for Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the minister said, noting that these sectors rely directly on energy as a primary component for operation and growth.
El-Khatib added that ongoing economic transformations in both nations provide a significant foundation for building wider investment partnerships. He said the two countries aim to present a globally competitive regional model through policies that attract capital and utilise renewable energy to build a low-carbon economy.
Strategies currently being implemented aim to achieve a sustainable, long-term balance in the energy sector, the minister said. He noted that recently announced deals reflect the seriousness of current trends and the region’s ability to attract additional capital.
El-Khatib concluded that Egypt’s structural reforms are designed to build industrial capabilities based on clean energy and AI, reinforcing the country’s position as a regional hub for energy, manufacturing, and logistics.
The panel, titled “Sustainable Investment Opportunity”, also included Saudi Investment Minister Khalid Al-Falih, Vision Invest Africa Advisory Board Chair Amadou Hott, EIG Partners MENA Chairperson Abdulaziz Al-Gudaimi, and ACWA Power CEO Marco Arcelli.",253,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8842384219169617,2025-12-10T09:28:30.044586

The meeting aligns with Egypt’s national strategy to scale up renewable energy within its power mix and advance the country’s broader energy transition agenda.
Esmat highlighted the government’s commitment to opening new avenues for British companies in clean energy, ranging from solar and wind power projects to grid-strengthening initiatives and the localization of key electrical components used in renewable systems.
He noted that Egypt aims to raise the share of renewable energy in its electricity mix to more than 42% by 2030 and 65% by 2040, in line with its long-term sustainable development and decarbonization plans. The Minister also underscored the role of modern technologies, knowledge exchange, and specialized training, emphasizing that the private sector remains an essential partner in advancing the country’s renewable energy portfolio.
Esmat further stressed the centrality of the electricity sector to Egypt’s industrial, agricultural, and urban development. He pointed to the country’s abundant solar and wind resources and reiterated the government’s efforts to foster an attractive investment environment, draw foreign capital, and work closely with international financial institutions to implement large-scale renewable projects.
Ambassador Bryson-Richardson praised the depth of expertise within Egypt’s electricity sector and affirmed the UK’s eagerness to enhance cooperation across various segments of the power industry. He also expressed his commitment to encouraging more British investors to explore opportunities in Egypt’s expanding renewable energy market.
The two sides agreed to maintain close coordination to support ongoing projects and broaden joint initiatives that contribute to cleaner energy, lower emissions, and sustainable economic growth.",292,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8840985298156738,2025-12-10T09:28:50.631326

During the meeting, Fountain Set outlined its plans to expand into the Egyptian market through the establishment of a new spinning and weaving complex. The proposed industrial facility will span 200,000 square metres and may operate under either the free zone regime or the special economic zone framework. The project is expected to attract investments of approximately $100m, generate around 1,500 direct jobs, and serve as a key hub for producing and exporting textiles to European and African markets.
The discussions also covered the expansion plans of Elegance Apparel Garments Freezone, which aims to increase its production capacity and broaden its operational footprint in Shebin El-Kom.
Heiba reaffirmed Egypt’s readiness to accommodate new investments, noting that the state has injected more than $4bn into modernising public-sector factories, including the acquisition of advanced European machinery. He emphasised that Egypt offers flexible partnership models for foreign investors—ranging from ownership to leasing and usufruct arrangements—allowing companies to select structures tailored to their needs.
He further highlighted the distinctions between Egypt’s various investment regimes, including public and private free zones as well as special economic zones such as the Suez Canal Economic Zone. This diversity, he said, enables investors to choose the framework best suited to their project while benefiting from a wide array of incentives and facilitations.
According to Heiba, Egypt’s strategic geographic position, extensive free trade agreements, and competitive labour market make it an attractive destination for export-oriented textile and garment industries. He also pointed to the strong industrial base in Mahalla El-Kobra, whose advanced textile capabilities offer opportunities for integration with new investments and for maximising the use of existing expertise and equipment.
Heiba stressed that the textile industry remains a national priority due to its critical role in boosting exports, deepening local manufacturing, and creating employment. This focus, he noted, reflects the state’s commitment to attracting major investments and expanding domestic production capacity.
Representatives of Fountain Set and Elegance Apparel expressed their appreciation for Egypt’s supportive investment climate and the facilitation measures extended to investors. They affirmed their eagerness to move forward with project implementation and to strengthen cooperation with Egyptian authorities to ensure swift progress on their expansion plans.",403,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7233666181564331,2025-12-10T09:29:07.137429

Silver has now gained 110% since the start of 2025, outperforming gold and most major industrial commodities. The gold-to-silver ratio has fallen to 69, its lowest level since July 2021, reflecting silver’s sharp outperformance.
The report noted that local gold prices rose by EGP 1 during Wednesday’s trading, with 800-carat gold increasing from EGP 74.5 to EGP 75.25 per gram. Silver prices strengthened in parallel, with 925 silver reaching EGP 87 per gram, 999 silver rising to EGP 94, and the silver pound coin steady at EGP 696.
Globally, silver climbed from $58.27 to $61 per ounce amid heavy buying and rising investor positioning in metals markets.
The report highlighted several factors underpinning silver’s rally, including expanding industrial demand in electronics, solar energy and semiconductor manufacturing. Ongoing global supply-chain disruptions since August have further tightened supply, while renewed investor interest in silver as a hedging asset continues to add support.
According to the Safe Haven Center, London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) inventories have increased by 1,447 tonnes since the beginning of the year, while COMEX stocks have risen by 4,311 tonnes. Global silver holdings remain heavily concentrated in London at a ratio of 1.91 to COMEX—the highest level since January.
ETF holdings now represent 78% of silver stored in LBMA vaults, up from 65% in November 2024.
Silver-backed exchange-traded funds recorded their strongest inflows since 2020, adding 487 tonnes in November and over 475 tonnes since early December, signalling robust institutional interest.
Standard Chartered Bank said silver still has room for additional gains but warned of short-term volatility as the market seeks a new equilibrium following the recent surge. Analysts expect a limited correction before prices attempt new highs, particularly amid uncertainty surrounding the Critical Minerals S232 report, which could further tighten regional supply.
International outlets, including Reuters, The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, report that silver is undergoing a “strategic transformation,” functioning both as a core industrial metal and a major investment asset. Forecasts suggest prices may trade within the $55-$70 range in the near term.
Despite its strong performance, analysts caution that silver prices could retreat if U.S. economic indicators strengthen or if major mining regions significantly increase production.",405,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7234614491462708,2025-12-11T09:28:34.394189
2025-12-10,Egypt’s urban inflation eases to 12.3% in November 2025,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/10/egypts-urban-inflation-eases-to-12-3-in-november-2025/,"Egypt’s urban inflation eased slightly in November 2025, dipping to 12.3% from 12.5% in October, according to data released on Wednesday by the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics (CAPMAS). Monthly inflation slowed markedly to 0.3%, compared with 1.8% in the previous month.
CAPMAS reported that the nationwide consumer price index reached 263.8 points in November, edging down by 0.2% from October.
The Agency attributed the decline chiefly to a 15.8% fall in vegetable prices, alongside a 0.2% drop in cereals and bread, a 1.5% decrease in meat and poultry, a 0.8% decline in fish and seafood, a 1.2% reduction in dairy products, cheese and eggs, and a 0.4% fall in personal belongings.
However, several categories saw price increases. Oils and fats rose by 0.3%, as did coffee, tea and cocoa. Mineral water, soft drinks and natural juices increased by 0.4%, tobacco by 0.3%, fabrics by 0.6%, ready-made clothing by 1.2% and clothing cleaning, repair and rental services by 1.4%.
Housing-related costs also climbed, including actual rent (up 2.1%), imputed rent (2.0%), maintenance and repair (0.9%), water and housing services (0.6%), and electricity, gas and other fuels (3.9%). Furniture, furnishings, carpets and floor coverings rose by 0.6%, household textiles by 1.3%, and glassware, tableware and household utensils by 0.9%.
Additional increases were recorded in home maintenance goods and services (1.4%), outpatient services (1.1%), hospital services (2%), vehicle purchases (2.1%), private transport expenditure (6.4%), transport services (8.3%), ready-made meals (1.3%), hotel services (1.6%) and personal care (1.4%).
Monthly core CPI inflation, computed by the Central Bank of Egypt, recorded 0.8% in November 2025, compared with 0.4% in November 2024 and 2.0% in October 2025. On an annual basis, core CPI inflation rose to 12.5% in November, up from 12.1% in October.
CAPMAS noted that the annual nationwide inflation rate stood at 10% in November, fractionally lower than 10.1% in October.
On 20 November, the Central Bank of Egypt’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) opted to keep key interest rates unchanged at 21% for deposits, 22% for lending and 21.5% for the credit and discount rate and the main operation rate, a decision widely anticipated by analysts and investment banks.
In its accompanying statement, the MPC said the decision reflected its assessment of recent inflation developments and the outlook since its previous meeting. It noted that further declines in monthly inflation were necessary to steer headline inflation towards the Bank’s target. It also reiterated expectations that annual headline inflation would rise towards the end of the fourth quarter due to higher energy prices before easing again in the second half of 2026, moving closer to target.
The Committee cautioned that inflation expectations remained exposed to upside risks both globally and domestically, including potential geopolitical escalations, persistently elevated service-price inflation and fiscal consolidation measures exceeding expectations.
It stressed that these risks required close monitoring and a cautious approach to the monetary easing cycle. Maintaining policy rates, it noted, supported efforts to contain inflationary pressures, anchor expectations and restore the downward inflation path.
The MPC confirmed that its decisions would continue to be made on a meeting-by-meeting basis and remain guided by the outlook, associated risks and incoming data. It added that it would not hesitate to use all available tools to achieve price stability and guide inflation towards its target of 7% (± 2%) on average in the fourth quarter of 2026.",559,daily_news_egypt,error,0.0,2025-12-11T09:29:33.089818

“We strongly oppose any alteration to the borders of Gaza and Israel,” UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said at a daily press briefing. He added that the comments run counter to both the spirit and the letter of the peace framework advanced by U.S. President Donald Trump, stressing that the UN recognizes only the established borders between Gaza and Israel.
The statement comes amid a deepening humanitarian crisis. Gaza’s Ministry of Health reported Wednesday that three people were killed and five wounded in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll since the war began in October 2023 to 70,369, with 171,069 injured.
Medical sources and eyewitnesses said a teenage boy from Jabalia refugee camp, Zahir Nasser Shamia, was fatally shot by Israeli forces and then run over by a tank near the so-called yellow line. According to sources who spoke with Anadolu Agency, Israeli troops had pushed into areas crowded with displaced families in Jabalia, firing heavily and blocking ambulances from reaching the critically wounded teenager. In a separate incident, a man and a woman were killed after being hit by Israeli military cranes near the Halawa camp for displaced people.
As military operations continue, winter conditions are compounding the already dire humanitarian situation. The Emergency Response Operations Room in Gaza urged international agencies to deliver shelter materials immediately, warning that heavy overnight rainfall had flooded dozens of tents and destroyed the belongings of displaced families. The group said the deteriorating conditions could lead to deaths among children and the elderly, given plunging temperatures and a severe shortage of basic protection. It described the provision of shelter as “a matter of saving lives” and called for urgent coordination to reach the hardest-hit areas.
Gaza’s municipality issued a parallel warning, citing the collapse of key infrastructure following months of bombardment. Municipal spokesperson Husni Mehanna said seven of the city’s eight main wastewater pumping stations have been destroyed, disabling roughly 90 percent of the system’s capacity. As a result, the city can process only about 20 percent of rainfall, raising the risk of widespread flooding in neighborhoods overcrowded with displaced civilians.
The UN has also highlighted the escalating threat posed by unexploded ordnance scattered across the strip. Julius van der Walt, head of the UN Mine Action Programme in the occupied Palestinian territories, said remnants of war are a major obstacle to restoring normal life, especially as hundreds of thousands of people begin moving around Gaza following the ceasefire. “Children are the most at risk,” he said, pointing to their curiosity and limited awareness of the dangers.
Regional leaders continue to press for steps toward a political solution. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said a “just and lasting peace” in Gaza requires strengthening the ceasefire and pursuing a two-state solution. He described the deaths of more than 70,000 Palestinians as a “grave violation” of the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
In Cairo, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty stressed in a call with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio the need to move to the second phase of the ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel. He urged implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2803, including the deployment of an international stabilization force in Gaza, the formation of a Palestinian technocratic committee to administer the strip, the safe delivery of humanitarian aid, and the reconstruction of critical infrastructure.
Meanwhile, Hamas condemned Israel’s approval of 764 new settlement units as “an expansionist measure” and a “serious escalation” that violates international law and UN Security Council resolutions. The group called on the international community to impose binding measures to halt settlement expansion.",638,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.8930813074111938,2025-12-11T09:30:27.267683
2025-12-13,Madbouly inspects Decent Life development projects in Qalyubeya,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/13/madbouly-inspects-decent-life-development-projects-in-qalyubeya/,"Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly conducted an inspection tour of several development projects implemented under the presidential Decent Life (Decent Life) initiative in villages of Shebin El-Qanater, Qalyubeya, as part of the government’s ongoing efforts to improve living standards and public services in rural areas.
The tour began with a visit to the Technological Center in Tahanoub village, where Madbouly reviewed the services provided to citizens.
Deputy Governor of Qalyubeya Eman Rayan explained that the center is one of the most significant development projects under the initiative and forms part of nine integrated service complexes established across Shebin El-Qanater. She noted that the facility operates as a one-stop hub for government and civil services, easing access for residents of Tahanoub and neighbouring villages and reducing the need to travel to urban centres.
Rayan added that the centre supports Egypt’s Vision 2030 digital transformation agenda by shifting from paper-based procedures to fully automated services. The facility includes a local administrative unit, food subsidy office, civil registry, real estate registry, modern post office and social affairs office. The project was completed at a cost of approximately EGP 9m, has reached full completion and is now fully operational.
Madbouly then inspected the Family Medicine Center in Tahanoub, implemented during the first phase of the Decent Life initiative.
He said health-sector projects under the initiative reflect the state’s commitment to delivering comprehensive and sustainable healthcare services, particularly in underserved areas.
Deputy Prime Minister for Human Development and Minister of Health and Population Khaled Abdel Ghaffar noted that Decent Life health projects are implemented through an integrated system that includes building and upgrading hospitals and health units, equipping medical facilities, and establishing specialised centres—an approach embodied by the Tahanoub Family Medicine Center.
Undersecretary of the Ministry of Health in Qalyubeya Osama El-Shalqani stated that the centre is one of 24 similar healthcare projects completed in Shebin El-Qanater villages. The three-storey facility provides a wide range of primary healthcare services, including family medicine, dental clinics, emergency care, pharmacy services, laboratories, radiology, maternal and child health services and administrative offices.
The centre was established at a cost of around EGP 60m, spans 850 sqm, includes 58 rooms and is staffed by 83 medical and administrative personnel. During the visit, Madbouly toured isolation rooms and clinics, reviewed service quality, checked medicine availability and assessed citizen turnout.
As part of the tour, the Prime Minister visited the Misr Public Library in Shebin El-Qanater, reaffirming the state’s support for cultural projects targeting youth and children. He stressed that public libraries play a vital role in spreading awareness, developing skills and supporting Egypt’s broader human development strategy.
Qalyubeya Governor Ayman Attia described the facility as a major cultural addition to the governorate, noting that it is the second Misr Public Library in Qalyubeya after Banha, with a third branch currently under construction in Shubra El-Kheima.
Ambassador Reda El-Taify, Director of the Misr Public Libraries Fund, said the Shebin El-Qanater branch is the 31st nationwide, within a network of 34 public libraries across 18 governorates, in addition to 24 mobile libraries.
The library consists of three floors and includes children’s and adults’ reading halls, a computer lab, activity and training rooms, a cultural theatre, creative learning spaces and a modern digital library. Madbouly interacted with children and students during the visit, encouraging them to read widely and deepen their knowledge of Egypt’s history and sciences.
The Prime Minister concluded his tour by inspecting the Veterinary Unit in Nowa village, another Decent Life project.
Undersecretary of the Veterinary Directorate in Qalyubeya, Hany Shams El-Din, explained that the unit is part of nine veterinary projects implemented in Shebin El-Qanater. The facility provides integrated veterinary services, including animal and poultry examinations, vaccinations, artificial insemination, ultrasound diagnostics, free medical convoys and a veterinary pharmacy.
Built on an area of 425 sqm, the unit serves four villages and surrounding areas and is fully operational. Madbouly also reviewed services offered by the adjacent agricultural complex, including farmer training programmes on modern cultivation techniques and safe pest-control methods.
The tour underscored the government’s continued commitment to implementing the Decent Life initiative as a comprehensive rural development model, aimed at upgrading infrastructure and expanding access to healthcare, education, culture and agricultural services across Egypt’s villages.",704,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.5574158430099487,2025-12-14T09:22:15.959410

2025-12-13,Egypt’s external debt reaches $161.2bn in June 2025: CBE,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/13/egypts-external-debt-reaches-161-2bn-in-june-2025-cbe/,"Egypt’s external debt rose to $161.2bn in June 2025, marking an increase of around $8.3bn, or 5.5%, compared with the end of June 2024, according to data released by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). The rise mainly reflected higher disbursements of external loans and credit facilities amounting to $5.4bn, in addition to valuation effects of about $2.9bn stemming from the depreciation of the US dollar against other currencies in which Egypt’s external debt is denominated.
Breakdown by Maturity
By original maturity, Egypt’s external debt structure continued to be dominated by long-term borrowing in June 2025. Long-term external debt stood at $130.3bn, while short-term debt by original maturity amounted to $30.9bn. Measured by residual maturity, short-term external debt reached approximately $54.6bn at the same date.
Breakdown by Type
The stock of long-term external debt increased by about $3.4bn year-on-year to reach $130.3bn in June 2025. This increase reflected mixed developments across debt instruments. Other bilateral debt rose to $18.6bn, up by $4.6bn, while repurchase agreements reached around $6.7bn. Bonds, notes and sukuk issued abroad and held by non-residents climbed to $28.7bn, representing an increase of about $1bn.
During FY 2024/2025, Egypt returned to international debt markets with two new issuances. The first was a $2bn Eurobond issued in US dollars, followed by a $1bn sukuk through a private placement with Kuwait Finance House. As of the end of June 2025, the outstanding stock of Egypt’s external bonds comprised approximately $20.3bn of US dollar-denominated Eurobonds, the equivalent of $3.5bn of euro-denominated Eurobonds, around $2.4bn of US dollar sukuk, the equivalent of $936.2m in Samurai bonds issued in Japanese yen, about $663.0m in US dollar green bonds, the equivalent of $488.5m in Panda bonds denominated in Chinese yuan, and roughly $345.5m in sovereign notes issued in US dollars.
Non-guaranteed private sector external debt increased by $0.7bn to reach $2.5bn, including $100m in green bonds and $499m in sustainability bonds. Meanwhile, rescheduled bilateral debt declined slightly by $0.2bn to $0.5bn. Long-term deposits, represented by Arab countries’ deposits at the CBE, remained unchanged at $9.3bn, comprising $5.3bn from Saudi Arabia and $4bn from Kuwait. Buyers’ and suppliers’ credit declined by $0.9bn to about $19.2bn, while debt owed to multilateral institutions fell by $4.1bn to reach approximately $44.8bn in June 2025.
Short-term external debt by original maturity rose by $4.9bn year-on-year to reach $30.9bn in June 2025. Deposits from Arab countries at the CBE accounted for around 35.9% of this stock, equivalent to $11.1bn.
Breakdown by Currency
An assessment of the currency composition of Egypt’s external debt shows that the US dollar remained the dominant borrowing currency in June 2025. US dollar-denominated debt amounted to $109.7bn, representing 68.0% of total external debt. The euro followed with $20bn, while other currencies collectively totalled $31.5bn. These included Special Drawing Rights valued at $15bn, the Chinese yuan at $5.9bn, the Kuwaiti dinar and the Japanese yen at $3.8bn each, and other currencies amounting to $3bn.
Breakdown by Creditor
By creditor type, Egypt’s external debt to multilateral institutions stood at $47.2bn in June 2025. The International Monetary Fund accounted for 30.1% of this total, equivalent to $14.2bn. This comprised $5.8bn under the Extended Fund Facility, $3.9bn related to Egypt’s IMF Special Drawing Rights allocation, $3.3bn under the New Extended Fund Facility, and $1.2bn under the Stand-By Arrangement.
Other major multilateral creditors included the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development with claims of $12.6bn, the European Investment Bank at $3.6bn, the African Development Bank at $2.6bn, and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development at $2.2bn.
In addition, Egypt owed $37.7bn to Arab countries, led by Saudi Arabia with $13.5bn, followed by the UAE with $11.7bn and Kuwait with $6bn. Furthermore, $18.8bn was owed to six Paris Club countries—Russia, the United States, Japan, France, Germany and the United Kingdom—while debt owed to China stood at $9.6bn.
Breakdown by Debtor Sector
By debtor sector, the Central Bank of Egypt’s external debt increased by about $2.7bn year-on-year to reach $37.3bn, accounting for 23.1% of total external debt, mainly due to a rise in long-term liabilities. External debt owed by other sectors rose by around $2.3bn to $19.7bn, reflecting higher short-term trade credits and long-term loans.
The government remained the largest obligor, with its external debt increasing by about $1.8bn to reach $82bn and accounting for roughly 50.8% of total external debt, largely as a result of increased bond issuance. Banks’ external debt rose by around $1.5bn to $22.2bn, representing 13.9% of the total, driven by higher short-term borrowing despite a decline in long-term debt.
External Debt Service
External debt service payments increased by $5.8bn to reach $38.7bn during FY 2024/2025, compared with FY 2023/2024. This increase was largely due to a rise of about $6.5bn in principal repayments, which totalled $30.2bn, while interest payments declined modestly by around $0.7bn to $8.5bn.
External Debt Indicators
Key external debt indicators showed that the ratio of external debt stock to GDP rose to 44.2% in June 2025, compared with 38.8% a year earlier. Short-term external debt by original maturity accounted for 19.2% of total external debt, up from 17.0% in June 2024, while its ratio to net international reserves increased to 63.5% from 56.1%.
Short-term external debt by residual maturity represented 33.8% of total external debt, slightly lower than the 34.5% recorded a year earlier, and its ratio to net international reserves declined to 112.0% from 113.8%. Meanwhile, the ratio of external debt stock to exports of goods and services improved to 223.0%, down from 243.4%. The annual debt service ratio rose to 53.6% from 52.4%, while the debt service ratio to current receipts declined to 34.5%, compared with 37.8% in June 2024.",939,daily_news_egypt,error,0.0,2025-12-14T09:22:45.314136

These include regulatory fragmentation, algorithmic bias, data-protection concerns and escalating cyber threats, all of which require robust digital infrastructure and adaptive legislative frameworks.
Abdalla made the remarks during the 20th High-Level Annual Meeting on Financial Stability and Supervisory Priorities, held in Abu Dhabi and organised by the Arab Monetary Fund in cooperation with the Financial Stability Institute and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at the Bank for International Settlements.
He underscored the importance of the issues discussed at the forum, noting that financial stability and evolving supervisory priorities have become a cornerstone of development ambitions across the Arab region. This comes at a time when the global economy is undergoing a complex transition marked by elevated inflation, volatile liquidity conditions and rapidly shifting geopolitical dynamics.
The CBE governor said these pressures are particularly pronounced in the Arab world due to high public-debt levels and persistent fluctuations in exchange rates and oil prices, factors that directly affect public finances, economic activity and investor confidence.
According to Abdalla, such challenges have compelled central banks to play a more expansive role in protecting monetary stability, reinforcing economic resilience and building more flexible financial systems capable of supporting growth, absorbing unexpected shocks and preserving market confidence.
He also highlighted the rapid expansion of non-bank financial institutions, whose share now accounts for nearly half of global financial assets. While these entities act as key drivers of market development and contribute to economic growth and financial inclusion, they also pose heightened risks that require more advanced, transparent and forward-looking regulatory frameworks.
Abdalla pointed to the accelerating pace of technological innovation, particularly the growing use of digital assets and stablecoins. He noted that their value has doubled over the past three years and that they now play an increasingly significant role in cross-border payments and transfers.
Turning to recent global banking stresses, Abdalla referenced the banking tensions witnessed in 2023 following the collapse of four banks. He said these events exposed the limitations of traditional liquidity standards in an environment characterised by rapid digital withdrawals and instantaneous fund transfers across online platforms. The failures, he explained, were driven by a combination of weak governance, inadequate risk management, unsustainable business models and insufficient supervisory oversight. These developments underscore the need for updated stress-testing frameworks, stronger operational preparedness and more proactive supervision capable of identifying vulnerabilities at an early stage.
Abdalla concluded by stressing that today’s financial stability challenges are inherently cross-border and cannot be effectively addressed by any single country acting alone. Enhanced cooperation and coordinated action are therefore essential to developing shared visions that strengthen the resilience of Arab financial systems and enable them to manage emerging risks while embracing innovation that supports sustainable development.",484,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.6743252873420715,2025-12-14T09:22:48.019179
2025-12-13,Egypt’s agricultural exports reach 8.8m tonnes to date: Agriculture Minister,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/13/egypts-agricultural-exports-reach-8-8m-tonnes-to-date-agriculture-minister/,"Alaa Farouk, Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, said total Egyptian agricultural exports have reached approximately 8.8 million tonnes so far this year, marking an increase of nearly 750,000 tonnes compared with the same period last year.
The figures were outlined in an official report submitted to the Minister by Mohamed El-Mounsi, Head of the Central Administration for Agricultural Quarantine at the Agricultural Services and Monitoring Sector, which detailed the latest developments and performance indicators for Egypt’s agricultural exports.
According to the report, citrus fruits continued to top the list of Egyptian agricultural exports, with total shipments exceeding 2 million tonnes. Fresh potatoes ranked second at around 1.3m tonnes, followed by sweet potatoes in third place with approximately 328,000 tonnes. Beans, both fresh and dry, came fourth with about 312,000 tonnes, while fresh onions ranked fifth with exports totalling roughly 282,000 tonnes.
The report also highlighted the strong export performance of several other crops, including grapes at around 191,000 tonnes, pomegranates at 154,000 tonnes, and mangoes at approximately 122,000 tonnes. Additional exports included tomatoes, fresh strawberries, fresh garlic and guava, reflecting the growing diversity of Egypt’s agricultural export basket.
In this context, Farouk said the record rise in agricultural exports provides clear evidence of the strength and resilience of the national economy. He added that the performance reflects Egypt’s commitment to meeting the highest international standards of quality and food safety, and represents global recognition of the country’s success in enhancing the competitiveness of its agricultural products.
The Minister noted that Egyptian agricultural products continue to enjoy strong confidence in international markets, reinforcing Egypt’s position as a leading global agricultural producer and exporter. He stressed that agricultural exports represent a key pillar of the national economy, contributing to foreign-currency inflows and supporting economic growth. Farouk also praised the collective efforts exerted across the entire value chain, from farmers and producers to exporters.
He further highlighted the pivotal role of the Central Administration for Agricultural Quarantine and the reference laboratories in ensuring the safety and quality of exported products, alongside the contribution of agricultural external relations. Farouk underscored the Ministry’s continued efforts, in coordination with relevant authorities, to open new and non-traditional markets, address logistical and procedural challenges facing exporters, and support the sustainability of growth in the agricultural export sector.",380,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9373766779899596,2025-12-14T09:23:09.286370
2025-12-13,saib Bank signs EGP 1.5bn mortgage-finance protocol with Social Housing Fund,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/13/saib-bank-signs-egp-1-5bn-mortgage-finance-protocol-with-social-housing-fund/,"saib Bank has signed a cooperation protocol with the Social Housing and Mortgage Finance Fund to strengthen collaboration in mortgage financing and provide funding for eligible applicants under the Fund’s housing programmes targeting low- and middle-income segments.
The protocol was signed by Afdal El-Sayed Naguib, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of saib Bank, and May Abdel Hamid, Chief Executive Officer of the Social Housing and Mortgage Finance Fund. The signing ceremony was attended by Tarek Abdo, Deputy Managing Director of saib Bank, alongside several senior bank executives. Representatives from the Fund included Hala Ghazy, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, and Omnia El-Maddawy, General Director of the Support Department.
Naguib said the bank’s participation in the Central Bank of Egypt’s mortgage-finance initiative for low- and middle-income households aligns with saib’s strategy to support the state’s development agenda and Egypt’s Vision 2030, which prioritises sustainable economic growth and extending support to the most vulnerable segments of society.
He added that mortgage financing remains a core priority for saib Bank, noting that the institution continuously assesses the needs of underserved groups and designs financing solutions tailored to their income levels and housing requirements. This approach, he said, is consistent with the CBE’s direction towards promoting social inclusion and economic sustainability.
Naguib stressed that the new protocol aims to help citizens secure residential units offered through the Fund’s various housing announcements, with the broader objective of providing safe, adequate and affordable homes for low-income families. He reaffirmed the bank’s commitment to offering flexible procedures and expanding access to mortgage finance, while strengthening its role within Egypt’s social-housing ecosystem.
For her part, Abdel Hamid said the Fund is keen to deepen cooperation with the banking sector to better serve applicants seeking affordable housing units. She highlighted saib Bank’s longstanding role as a key partner in providing mortgage financing to low- and middle-income citizens, noting that it was among the first private banks to collaborate with the Fund in this field.
She explained that the newly signed protocol renews a previous agreement between the two sides that was first concluded on 1 September 2020. Under the renewed arrangement, saib Bank will provide up to EGP 1.5bn in mortgage financing for eligible applicants, an expansion that further strengthens cooperation between the two institutions in support of the state’s affordable-housing initiatives.
Tarek Abdo, Deputy Managing Director of saib Bank, said the bank believes that every citizen has the right to adequate housing and is committed to simplifying financing procedures and offering practical banking solutions that meet the needs of low-income households, enabling them to acquire suitable homes under affordable terms.
He added that the partnership with the Social Housing and Mortgage Finance Fund reflects saib Bank’s broader commitment to supporting state-led initiatives that promote social justice and improve citizens’ quality of life. He noted that such projects not only address housing needs but also contribute to job creation and stimulate economic activity in sectors linked to real-estate development.
Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to deepening cooperation, emphasising that the new protocol builds on an established partnership and ensures continued access to mortgage financing for low- and middle-income citizens seeking housing through the Fund’s programmes.",526,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.789056658744812,2025-12-14T09:23:36.399670
2025-12-13,Opinion | Is now the right time to cut reserve requirements?,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/13/opinion-is-now-the-right-time-to-cut-reserve-requirements/,"The reserve requirement is one of the central monetary-policy instruments used by central banks to regulate liquidity and safeguard financial stability. In Egypt, it represents the share of bank deposits that the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) requires supervised commercial banks to hold as non-interest-bearing reserves. By setting this ratio, the CBE directly influences banks’ lending capacity and the overall resilience of the financial system.
Typically, the CBE raises the reserve requirement during periods of elevated inflation to absorb excess liquidity and contain price pressures. Conversely, when inflation moderates and moves closer to target, the ratio may be reduced to support credit growth and economic activity.
Any decision to lower the reserve requirement depends on several fundamental conditions, foremost among them a sustained decline in inflation and the stability of medium-term inflation expectations. Policymakers must be confident that core inflation is firmly under control and that expectations among households and businesses are well anchored around the target.
Central banks therefore tend to approach such a step with caution. A reduction from the current 18% level back to the previous 14%, for example, would release an additional 4% of banks’ total deposits for lending or investment. This would require strong assurance that the newly injected liquidity would not reignite inflationary pressures. At the same time, a lower reserve requirement would give banks greater flexibility in pricing loans and financial products, support profitability through expanded lending, and potentially allow part of the cost savings to translate into improved returns for depositors, thereby encouraging higher savings.
Despite these potential benefits, it may still be premature for the CBE to restore the reserve requirement to 14% or even to begin a gradual reduction at this stage.
Cutting the reserve requirement is a double-edged sword. Injecting a sizeable amount of liquidity into the system could have a stronger-than-intended impact on market conditions, complicating efforts to keep future inflation in check. This risk explains why central banks often prefer to rely on interest rates, which offer a more flexible and finely calibrated policy lever.
Any move in this direction would need to be carefully sequenced and could require a phased approach. Timing would be critical, and it may be more prudent to wait until inflation has stabilised at decisively lower levels before proceeding.
In my view, a reduction in the reserve requirement is more likely to be considered during the latter half of the monetary-easing cycle, once inflation is clearly converging towards target and macroeconomic conditions are more firmly anchored.
Ultimately, a cut in the reserve requirement would represent a meaningful policy shift, but one that demands precise timing and rigorous analysis. Acting too early risks doing more harm than good. For now, patience and a continued focus on broader economic stability appear to be the wiser course.

2025-12-13,"Winter storm compounds Gaza humanitarian crisis amid Israeli strikes, diplomatic efforts",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/13/winter-storm-compounds-gaza-humanitarian-crisis-amid-israeli-strikes-diplomatic-efforts/,"A winter storm that battered the Gaza Strip over the past few days has worsened an already dire humanitarian situation, killing additional people and exacerbating the impact of Israeli strikes, Palestinian officials said, as diplomatic efforts over the territory’s future gain momentum.
Ismail Al-Thawabta, director general of Gaza’s Government Media Office, described the three-day weather system as creating a “compound humanitarian disaster” on top of the devastation caused by Israeli military operations. Speaking at a news conference at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza on Saturday, he reported 11 deaths and one missing person after buildings previously damaged by bombardment collapsed under harsh weather conditions.
Al-Thawabta said government teams had documented the collapse of at least 13 homes, all hit earlier by Israeli strikes. More than 27,000 tents sheltering displaced people were swept away or flooded, while a total of over 53,000 tents suffered full or partial damage, leaving hundreds of thousands exposed to the elements.
Separately, Gaza’s Health Ministry reported that three Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire over the past 48 hours, with 16 wounded admitted to hospitals during the same period. Since a ceasefire took effect on October 10, the ministry said the death toll has reached 386, with 1,018 people injured.
On the military front, The Israeli occupation army’s radio reported an airstrike in Gaza City targeting what it described as Hamas’s second-in-command, Raed Saad, claiming he had been involved in rebuilding the group’s capabilities and weapons production. Hamas did not immediately comment.
US media have reported that Bulgarian diplomat Nikolay Mladenov is a potential candidate to represent a proposed “Peace Council” backed by the United States and endorsed by the UN Security Council to oversee Gaza in a future phase, following Arab objections to the nomination of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Neither nomination has been officially confirmed.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said any peace council must address what he described as the security problem posed by Israel. Speaking after a visit to Turkmenistan, Erdogan emphasised that Israel must honour its commitments and fully adhere to the ceasefire to allow life in Gaza to return to normal.
Humanitarian crisis
At the United Nations, Rick Peeperkorn, WHO representative in the occupied Palestinian territories, said approximately 1,092 patients in Gaza had died while awaiting medical evacuation between July 2024 and November 28, 2025. He warned that the figure is likely an underestimate. Peeperkorn added that 18 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals and 43% of primary healthcare centres were only partially functioning amid severe shortages of essential medicines and medical supplies. While some improvement has been seen in aid delivery approvals, the process of bringing medical equipment and drugs into Gaza remains “slow and unnecessarily complex.”
UNICEF warned of a severe health crisis, noting that malnourished pregnant women are giving birth to underweight and premature babies, many of whom are dying in neonatal intensive care or facing lifelong medical complications.
Two US officials said that US Central Command will host a conference in Doha on December 16 with partner nations to develop a plan for an international force to stabilise Gaza. More than 25 countries are expected to send representatives to discuss command structures and operational frameworks.
In New York, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution urging Israel to allow full humanitarian access to Gaza, stop obstructing UN agencies and comply with international law.

2025-12-14,Multiple pathways to deepen private-sector partnerships across key industries: El-Shimy,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/14/multiple-pathways-to-deepen-private-sector-partnerships-across-key-industries-el-shimy/,"Mohamed El-Shimy, Minister of the Public Enterprises Sector, presented the portfolio of companies affiliated with the ministry and reviewed their financial performance over the past decade during his participation in the Afro-Asian Investors Union Forum.
He said the forum represents a vital platform for strengthening historic ties and opening new horizons for investment cooperation and partnership between African and Asian countries. El-Shimy added that deeper investment integration between the two continents is a cornerstone for achieving sustainable development and accelerating economic growth amid ongoing global challenges.
The minister stressed that the Egyptian state places strong emphasis on expanding joint investment opportunities and building effective strategic partnerships based on mutual benefit. He explained that companies affiliated with the Ministry of Public Enterprises Sector constitute a key pillar of the national economy, encompassing eight holding companies operating in the metallurgical, chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, tourism, hotel and construction sectors. These holdings supervise 63 subsidiary companies, in addition to stakes in 106 joint-venture firms active across a wide range of productive and service industries.
El-Shimy noted that this framework aligns with Egypt Vision 2030, the Government Action Programme and the State Ownership Policy Document, ensuring coherence between public-sector reform and national development objectives.
He outlined the ministry’s ongoing comprehensive reform programmes aimed at improving corporate performance, modernising management systems, expanding private-sector participation, and keeping pace with technological advances. These efforts, he said, are being implemented in line with international standards for quality, sustainability, occupational safety and health, governance and human-capital development. The overarching objective is to maximise returns on state investments, enhance companies’ contribution to GDP, and strengthen their competitiveness at both local and international levels.
Mohamed El-Shimy, Minister of the Public Enterprises Sector
According to the minister, these reforms have already delivered tangible results, with a marked improvement in financial performance driven by restructuring, technical and administrative modernisation, more efficient asset utilisation and higher operational productivity.
El-Shimy highlighted a broad pipeline of investment and partnership opportunities with domestic and international private investors. In the metallurgical industries, projects include expanding the Nagaa Hammadi Aluminium Complex by 300,000 tonnes, establishing a new aluminium smelter with an annual capacity of 600,000 tonnes, developing an alumina refinery with a capacity of 2 million tonnes per year, and launching value-added projects such as car wheel rims and aluminium foil. Additional initiatives include a solar-glass production unit at El-Nasr Glass and Crystal Company and a seamless-pipe production line at El-Nasr Pipes Company.
In the chemical industries, opportunities cover the second phase of Delta Fertilizers’ development plan, involving upgrades and capacity expansion for ammonia and urea plants, a kaolin calcination project, and the development of Abu Zenima Port, operated by Sinai Manganese Company.
The pharmaceuticals and medical supplies sector features projects to localise the production of biological products at Nile Pharmaceuticals, including insulin and biosimilar alternatives, alongside a dry-powder inhalation line at the Arab Company for Pharmaceuticals, hormone-manufacturing localisation at CID Pharma, and local production of active pharmaceutical ingredients at El-Nasr Pharmaceutical Chemicals Company.
In the textile sector, which is undergoing a nationwide modernisation programme across seven governorates, investment opportunities include establishing an integrated denim-fabric industrial complex at Damietta Textiles Company and a knitted-garment manufacturing facility at Dakahlia Textiles Company.
The tourism and hospitality sector also offers multiple prospects, including the development of a tourist resort in Marsa Alam, the rehabilitation of the historic Continental Hotel in downtown Cairo, the Dahab Camp project, the conversion of the Misr Tourism Tower into a mixed administrative-hotel facility, and the utilisation of several high-value commercial assets in hospitality activities.
El-Shimy also reviewed urban-development opportunities within the construction and housing portfolio. These include developing the green zone and recreational services in New Heliopolis City, operated by Heliopolis Housing and Development Company, as well as integrated residential, administrative and commercial projects by El-Nasr Housing and Development Company in Mokattam, Joseph Tito Avenue and along the Maadi Corniche. Additional projects encompass land reclamation, cultivation and livestock production initiatives in Toshka.
The minister reaffirmed the ministry’s commitment to providing all necessary facilitation and support to investors interested in these projects, describing private-sector partnership as a strategic pathway to achieving sustainable economic development and strengthening regional economic integration.",690,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7508752346038818,2025-12-15T09:34:42.180064

Gamal El-Din welcomed Jasan Group’s entry into the Qantara West Industrial Zone, describing the project as a high-quality addition to Egypt’s textile and garment industry. He highlighted that the company’s fully integrated production model provides strong competitive advantages in terms of efficiency, quality and production capacity.
He added that Jasan Group’s decision to locate in Qantara West reflects the zone’s operational readiness, advanced infrastructure, competitive costs and strategic location near Mediterranean and Red Sea ports, enhancing access to international markets.
Gamal El-Din also noted that the number of projects in the Qantara West Industrial Zone has now reached 48, covering a total area of 3.26m square metres, with combined investments estimated at $1.325bn. These projects are expected to create around 69,665 direct jobs.
He stressed that SCZONE continues to intensify efforts to attract further foreign investments into the textiles and garments sector, supporting Egypt’s strategy to expand industrial exports and advance sustainable economic growth.
Jasan Group is among the world’s leading manufacturers of seamless garments, operating a fully integrated production system that includes spinning, dyeing, knitting, embroidery, printing and packaging, alongside a specialised research and development centre.

The inaugural session brought together heads of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) units and financial inclusion managers from banks, alongside key stakeholders from Egypt’s financial ecosystem, including the Credit Guarantee Company (CGC), the Egyptian Credit Bureau (i-Score) and the Egyptian Banking Institute (EBI). International experts also participated, sharing insights on the challenges of operationalising artificial intelligence (AI) and showcasing global use cases adapted to emerging markets.
The event marked the official launch of the MasterTalks series, with each session set to focus on a specific theme related to the digital transformation of the banking sector, with the overarching objective of advancing financial inclusion. Discussions underscored the importance of leveraging digital transformation to modernise banking operations and demonstrated how emerging technologies can be integrated into financial systems.
Participants also highlighted the role of AI-driven tools in expanding access to both financial and non-financial services for individuals and MSMEs, helping address their diverse needs and opening new opportunities for financially underserved and excluded segments.
The joint initiative reflects the CBE’s and EBRD’s shared commitment to supporting innovation, strengthening capacity building within the banking sector, and promoting inclusive and sustainable growth across Egypt’s financial system.
It also underscores the CBE’s strong focus on advancing financial inclusion in line with Egypt’s Vision 2030, as part of its broader efforts to achieve economic empowerment and expand access to financial and banking services. These efforts rely heavily on modern technological innovations to accelerate digital transformation across the financial and banking sectors.
As a result, Egypt has recorded a marked improvement in financial inclusion in recent years. As of June 2025, the financial inclusion rate reached 76.3%, representing a 214% increase since 2016. Over the same period, banks’ lending portfolios directed to MSMEs grew by 395%.

2025-12-14,Qatar’s Al Mana Holding to invest $200m in Egypt sustainable aviation fuel plant,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/14/qatars-al-mana-holding-to-invest-200m-in-egypt-sustainable-aviation-fuel-plant/,"Qatar’s Al Mana Holding signed a contract on Sunday to invest $200m in a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production plant in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE), marking the first Qatari industrial investment in the zone.
The project, which will be executed by the newly established “Saf Fly Limited”, aims to produce 200,000 tonnes annually of SAF, BioPropane, and Bio Naphtha derived from refined used cooking oil.
Al Mana Holding has secured a long-term supply agreement with Shell to purchase the facility’s entire production output, with supply scheduled to begin by the end of 2027.
Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, who witnessed the signing at the government headquarters in the New Administrative Capital, said the project reinforces the economic zone’s capabilities in adopting renewable energy sources and supports the aviation sector in line with global environmental standards.
The signing coincides with the Egyptian-Qatari Business Forum held in Cairo on Sunday. Madbouly noted that the deal demonstrates positive developments in relations between Cairo and Doha, reflecting a desire by both leaderships to boost bilateral ties and increase joint investments.
The facility will cover a total area of 100,000 square metres in the Sokhna Integrated Zone, split between 70,000 square metres in the industrial area and 30,000 square metres at Sokhna Port. The investment cost of $200m is equivalent to approximately EGP 9.6bn.
Walid Gamal El-Din, Chairperson of the SCZONE, stated that environmental sustainability is a core pillar of the zone’s strategy.
“The project leads to a reduction in harmful emissions by rates ranging between 50-80% compared to traditional fuel,” Gamal El-Din said, adding that the zone has become an optimal destination for investment due to its infrastructure, diverse energy sources, and legislative incentives.
Abdulaziz Al Mana, CEO of Al Mana Holding and Chairman of Green Sky Capital, praised Egypt’s investment climate and the support from political leadership in both nations, describing the project as a distinguished partnership.
The contract was signed by Captain Ahmed Gamal, SCZONE Vice Chairperson for the Southern Zone, and Saad Mohammed Al Mana, Board Member of Al Mana Holding.
The Sokhna Integrated Zone is one of four industrial zones and six ports comprising the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE).

2025-12-14,"Afro-Asian Investors Forum spotlights opportunities, challenges in Egypt’s tourism real estate",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/14/afro-asian-investors-forum-spotlights-opportunities-challenges-in-egypts-tourism-real-estate/,"Senior real estate developers, investors and industry experts convened at the Afro-Asian General Investors Union Forum to examine opportunities and challenges in Egypt’s real estate sector, with a particular focus on tourism-oriented properties and real estate exports.
Discussions centred on boosting Egypt’s global competitiveness, attracting foreign investment, and leveraging major national projects alongside digital solutions to support sustainable sectoral growth.
Chairperson of Business Bay Developments, Amir Sami, said the company is focused on delivering globally standardised commercial and hospitality products that are export-ready, targeting overseas businesspeople and international firms. He noted that Egypt has all the ingredients needed to export real estate, including a favourable climate, strong tourism appeal and an attractive investment environment, while stressing that the semi-finished property model is unsuitable for export markets.
Ehab El-Obeidi, CEO of Rayn Developments, said that despite Egypt’s strong fundamentals, such as political stability and a strategic geographic location, its share of global real estate trade remains just 2.5% of a $250bn market. He emphasised the need for closer integration between the private sector and the state to unlock the sector’s full potential, calling for tax incentives and stronger government support, particularly in light of an estimated shortfall of 200,000 hotel units.
Chairperson of Tayel Group Wissam Tayel said real estate exports represent a key channel for attracting foreign currency inflows. He highlighted the investment potential of Upper Egypt, citing growing demand driven by universities and entertainment activities, and called for activating the hotel apartment model in the region, which receives around 500,000 Arab visitors annually. He also urged the government to simplify procedures for converting residential and administrative units into hotel use.
Founder and CEO of Prime Hospitality Management Group Moataz Amin said recent government decisions allow residential and administrative properties to be licensed as hotel units under specific security, safety and hygiene standards, without fees for properties comprising more than eight units—provided they are operated by specialised companies.
Advisor to the Afro-Asian Investors Union for Urban Development Abdel Aziz El-Kafrawy revealed that the sector has successfully exported and sold units worth $1.9bn. He underscored the need to establish a dedicated regulatory authority for Egypt’s real estate market and to develop a clear master plan to attract foreign investors, particularly to Upper Egypt.
Meanwhile, Managing Director and Vice Chairperson of Al Taamir Mortgage Finance – Al Oula Ayman Abdel Hamid said mortgage financing helps legalise property documentation and reassures foreign investors through the foreign ownership registry, adding that after-sales services remain among the sector’s key challenges.
Several speakers stressed the importance of finishing standards, architectural identity, fire safety codes and professional operating models in enhancing property value and export readiness. Others highlighted the growing role of proptech, digital solutions and integrated asset management in shaping the future of real estate development.
The session concluded with broad consensus that exporting real estate is no longer solely about construction, but about creating integrated, digitally enabled assets that deliver sustainable value, enhance user experience and strengthen Egypt’s position as a competitive destination for global real estate investment.",503,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8043287992477417,2025-12-15T09:36:08.489718

The projects are expected to cover three main sectors: educational institutions, government-affiliated entities, and service, investment, and industrial projects, which typically require advanced fire safety systems compliant with both local and international standards.
Karim Ahmed, CEO of Intelli-Pro, said the 2026 targets build on the company’s performance in 2025, when it completed projects valued at approximately EGP 70m. He attributed the growth to rising demand for fire protection systems and growing investor awareness of occupational safety and risk management.
Ahmed noted that Egypt’s fire-fighting systems market grew by more than 15% in 2025, with expectations that growth could approach 20% in the coming year. Key drivers include improved currency stability and stricter compliance requirements in industrial and service developments.
He also highlighted the role of the Civil Defense Authority, pointing to recent enhancements in inspection and approval procedures that have streamlined project implementation while maintaining rigorous safety standards.
Commenting on the broader industry landscape, Ahmed said that expanding domestic manufacturing in fire safety systems would benefit from greater access to financing, particularly for new and emerging industrial projects, supporting local production and reducing reliance on imports.
Founded in 2019, Intelli-Pro operates in the design, supply, installation, and maintenance of fire-fighting systems, as well as electromechanical and low-current systems. The company has delivered fire protection solutions for over 70 organisations across Egypt in sectors including industrial, telecommunications, aviation, and education.

2025-12-15,"Legislative, technological reforms expand access to non-banking financial activities: FRA chair",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/15/legislative-technological-reforms-expand-access-to-non-banking-financial-activities-fra-chair/,"Mohamed Farid, Chairperson of the Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA), said that the development of legislative and regulatory frameworks, alongside the expansion of fintech applications, has played a pivotal role in widening the base of beneficiaries of non-banking financial activities, while empowering youth and women to actively participate in capital markets, insurance and investment activities.
Speaking at the Top 50 Women STEM and Future Innovation Summit, Farid said that public service faces increasingly complex challenges due to overlapping interests and a growing number of stakeholders. This reality, he noted, requires continuous effort supported by strong scientific and professional reference frameworks. He stressed that ongoing education and engagement with international experiences, particularly in advanced economies, are essential for understanding markets and communicating effectively with investors and global institutions using a shared professional language.
Farid added that anyone engaged in public service must demonstrate constant diligence and a commitment to lifelong learning. He explained that he personally followed this approach by earning four master’s degrees to continuously update his knowledge and remain closely aligned with global developments in the financial sector, particularly in advanced markets. This, he said, enables effective communication with international investors and institutions in terms they understand, emphasising that solid scientific and professional grounding is the cornerstone of effective regulatory work.
The FRA chair pointed out that there is a common misconception among some members of the public that they fully understand the nature of work carried out by public institutions. In reality, however, the scale and complexity of the challenges facing public authorities make it essential to engage with citizens, explain the reforms being implemented, and clarify how these reforms affect their daily lives. Achieving this level of engagement, he said, is not possible without strong academic foundations and accumulated professional experience.
Farid explained that the FRA is among the public authorities most closely connected to citizens’ everyday lives, given its supervision of sectors that directly affect their needs. These include compulsory and supplementary motor insurance, private insurance and pension funds, insurance brokerage firms, actuarial services companies and investment funds.
In this context, Farid highlighted the Authority’s experience with gold investment funds, which were launched in 2023 from a standing start. Within a relatively short period, these funds succeeded in attracting investments of between EGP 4bn and EGP 5bn from nearly 250,000 investors. Many participants began with relatively small investment amounts, reflecting the FRA’s success in achieving one of its core objectives: promoting investment democracy and making investment opportunities accessible to all segments of society.
Farid cited a quote attributed to Albert Einstein, noting that one of the major problems in societies is continuing to do the same thing while expecting different results. He recalled the state of Egypt’s insurance sector in 1999, when insurance premiums accounted for less than 1% of GDP, at approximately 0.9%, highlighting the limited penetration of insurance services at the time.
He added that average insurance penetration rates range between 5% and 7% in emerging markets, and between 12% and 15% in advanced economies. Egypt’s insurance sector at the time also suffered from a shortage of actuaries, a highly specialised profession, as well as difficulties in accessing qualified human capital.
The human-capital challenge extended to educational curricula for insurance intermediaries. Farid noted that insurance premiums showed virtually no growth for years, with the sector remaining stagnant until he assumed the chairmanship of the FRA in 2022.
He stressed that it was no longer acceptable to continue operating using the same traditional approach, limited to issuing a series of regulatory decisions. Instead, the Authority adopted a fundamentally different path, centred on updating educational curricula and information frameworks as a primary gateway to genuine and sustainable reform.
Farid explained that when assessing markets, any financial regulatory authority must adhere to two non-negotiable objectives. The first is maintaining financial stability, which he described as the primary responsibility of any financial regulator. The second is developing and expanding market size. He said that the reforms adopted by the FRA were designed to generate tangible impact across financing activities, capital markets and the insurance sector.
Understanding the characteristics of new generations, particularly Generation Z and Generation Alpha, was a key driver behind these reforms, Farid said. He explained that these generations no longer have the inclination or patience to complete traditional procedures, such as physically visiting brokerage firms to sign contracts. As a result, Law No. 5 of 2022 regulating the use of technology in non-banking financial activities was enacted, delivering comprehensive impact across products and markets.
Farid noted that amendments introduced under this framework significantly eased access for young people to invest in the stock market. Previously, the annual average number of new investors obtaining trading codes ranged between 25,000 and 29,000. This figure jumped to approximately 340,000 in 2023, followed by 240,000 in 2024, reaching 281,000 investors by October of the current year. He emphasised that this qualitative leap was driven by the digitalisation of know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, alongside a broader package of market reforms.
Turning to the insurance sector, Farid highlighted the significant capital gap that had persisted for years. In 2007, the minimum capital requirement for banks stood at EGP 500m, compared with just EGP 60m for insurance companies. By 2020, bank capital requirements had risen to EGP 5bn, while insurance companies’ minimum capital remained unchanged at EGP 60m.
To address this imbalance, the FRA worked on issuing the Unified Insurance Law, which consolidated four separate laws into a single legislative framework. Following extensive discussions lasting between two and three years, the law raised the minimum capital requirement for insurance companies from EGP 60m to EGP 750m, ensuring recapitalisation, strengthening insurers’ ability to bear risks and enabling the development of more advanced insurance products.
As a result of these reforms, Farid noted that three to four insurance companies have begun offering comprehensive motor insurance policies for new vehicles, with the ability to complete all procedures digitally from home.
He stressed that the combined impact of legislative, regulatory and technological reforms has driven rising demand for functions that have become critically important from a supervisory perspective, most notably internal audit, governance and compliance. As a regulator, the FRA requires these functions to be in place within the institutions it supervises, which currently number around 3,900 entities.
In this context, Farid highlighted the role of the FRA-affiliated Financial Services Institute in qualifying human capital through specialised training programmes. He also drew attention to the regulation of third-party administrator (TPA) companies managing healthcare programmes and their placement under direct regulatory supervision, contributing to market organisation and the protection of stakeholders’ rights.
Farid concluded his speech by stressing the importance of empowering women and youth, particularly in the fields of science, technology and innovation, describing them as a fundamental pillar for building a more efficient, resilient and sustainable financial future.",1131,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.7958733439445496,2025-12-16T09:29:04.386321

The event featured Janet Henry, HSBC’s Global Chief Economist, and Simon Williams, HSBC’s Chief Economist for Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa (CEEMEA), who shared insights on growth prospects, risks and emerging opportunities amid an increasingly complex global environment.
Opening the event, Todd Wilcox, Deputy Chairperson and CEO of HSBC Bank Egypt, said Egypt was entering a new phase of stability and opportunity as economic reforms begin to yield tangible results.
“Egypt is entering a new chapter of stability and opportunity. The reform programme is starting to crystallise into real economic improvements,” Wilcox said. “With clearer policies and a more flexible operating environment, we are seeing renewed investor confidence across sectors and trade corridors. Our role as business leaders is to accelerate this momentum and turn confidence into sustainable, long-term growth.”
Addressing global economic trends, Janet Henry said markets may be underestimating inflationary pressures. “With sticky inflation and a relatively resilient economy supported by fiscal stimulus, markets still appear to be pricing in too many interest-rate cuts in 2026,” she said.
Focusing on Egypt’s macroeconomic outlook, Simon Williams noted that while challenges remain, the ongoing rebalancing process is laying the groundwork for recovery. “It is too soon to relax, but the rebalancing now under way opens the door to a proper recovery next year,” he said. “Over the longer term, structural reform will be critical. If Egypt gets it right, it could become an 8% growth story. Failure to deliver, however, would cap growth and leave the economy vulnerable to fresh shocks.”
The Economist Roadshow continues to serve as a platform where global insight meets local opportunity, helping clients and partners navigate economic change, anticipate market shifts and identify pathways for sustainable growth. The event also reaffirmed HSBC’s role as a trusted partner supporting Egypt’s long-term vision for economic resilience, innovation and sustainable development.",345,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8458131551742554,2025-12-16T09:29:24.954310

Speaking at a meeting with export council heads and Investment Minister Hassan El-Khatib, Madbouly called on local and foreign investors to seize current opportunities.
“Double your investments… the climate is attractive… and the opportunities are vast and promising, so seize them,” Madbouly told the assembly.
Record Exports Narrow Deficit
El-Khatib reported that for the first ten months of 2025, Egypt achieved its lowest trade deficit in ten years. Non-petroleum exports rose to a record $40.7bn, driving a total trade volume of $107.6bn. The minister attributed the improved balance of trade primarily to a $6.5bn annual increase in exports rather than import compression, signalling a genuine expansion in productive capacity.
Ministry data indicates the trade deficit had already narrowed by 16% year-on-year in the first ten months of 2025, dropping to roughly $26.3bn. The surge in exports has been notably driven by the UAE, which emerged as the top destination for Egyptian goods with $6.3bn in imports—a staggering 142% year-on-year increase.
Garments and ‘Property Exports’ to Lead 2026 Growth
Export councils presented a bullish outlook for 2026, driven by foreign direct investment (FDI) and supply chain localisation. The ready-made garments sector is forecast to grow by 28% to 30% next year, supported by recent capital injections from Egyptian, Chinese, and Turkish investors.
Industry leaders are targeting $4bn in exports by 2026. The sector has seen a shift in regional dynamics, with exports to Turkey soaring by 71% and shipments to Saudi Arabia doubling in recent months, as manufacturers capitalise on near-shoring trends.
Similarly, real estate “exports”—sales of properties to foreign buyers—are projected to rise by 30%. Council heads cited demand from Egyptian expatriates and Gulf nationals, particularly for developments in the Red Sea and the North Coast, specifically mentioning Ras El Hekma and Alam El-Roum.
The sector continues to be energised by the historic $35bn Ras El Hekma deal with UAE sovereign fund ADQ. Furthermore, the mention of Alam El-Roum likely refers to the developing partnership with Qatari Diar, which recently committed to a multi-billion-dollar project in the area, solidifying the North Coast’s status as a magnet for Gulf capital.
Furniture and Agriculture
In the furniture sector, officials highlighted a new factory in New Alamein city set to supply IKEA branches globally. The plant contributes to the localisation of production inputs, a strategy officials said is reducing the import bill.
Meanwhile, the food industries sector is targeting export growth of 15% to 18% next year. The agriculture council aims for a minimum 10% annual increase, noting that local components already constitute 95% of production. These targets align with the state’s broader “Narrative for Economic Development,” which aims to increase annual export values by 20% through 2030.
Madbouly concluded the meeting by praising the private sector’s resilience. “You took risks and succeeded… so seize the opportunity,” he said. “All economic indicators are positive.”",508,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9448106288909912,2025-12-16T09:29:53.678437

The package also allows private-sector companies contributing to strategic projects to deduct interest on external loans from their taxable base. Additional measures include replacing capital gains tax with a stamp duty to stimulate investment and trading on the Egyptian Exchange, as well as offering tax incentives to encourage the listing of large and influential companies on the stock market for a three-year period.
Kouchouk made the remarks during a meeting with real estate developers, noting that the incentives are designed to ease tax burdens by simplifying procedures and fostering an environment of trust and certainty with the tax community.
He said the second reform package comprises 25 measures aimed at responding to the needs of compliant taxpayers and encouraging voluntary tax compliance.
The minister explained that the incentives cover a wide range of sectors, including real estate development. Addressing developers, he said: “We look forward to receiving your ideas on facilitating, simplifying, standardising and digitalising tax procedures. The real estate sector is a key driver of economic activity, and we are working with you to promote real estate exports.”
Kouchouk stressed the importance of establishing a joint high-level committee for the real estate development sector to review challenges and work towards practical solutions.
He also announced plans to launch a mobile application dedicated to real estate transactions, enabling notification and simplified payment of due taxes. He confirmed that the tax rate on real estate transactions for individuals will remain fixed at 2.5% of the unit’s sale value, regardless of the number of transactions, with no additional administrative burdens.
Kouchouk added that institutional reforms are under way to accelerate and simplify value-added tax refunds, improving liquidity for business partners.
The second package also includes incentives to encourage the voluntary closure of tax files for the 2023 and 2024 tax years under fixed and proportional tax systems, building on progress achieved in the previous year. In addition, the VAT rate on medical devices will be reduced from 14% to 5%.
Addressing concerns related to property tax, Kouchouk reassured developers that a separate incentive package is being approved to ease burdens on citizens. The proposed measures include allowing the cancellation of property tax during times of crisis, raising the exemption threshold for private residences to EGP 4m, enabling electronic payment of property tax, waiving late-payment penalties in specific cases, capping penalties at no more than the original tax due, and reforming and simplifying the appeals mechanism.",435,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.7065399885177612,2025-12-16T09:29:58.939525

Designed to address the diverse needs of women entrepreneurs at different stages of their business journey, the programme offers a comprehensive package of non-financial services. These include specialised training and hands-on advisory support aimed at strengthening leadership, managerial and financial capabilities. Key focus areas cover digital marketing, brand development, business management, financial literacy and leadership, equipping participants with practical tools to enhance sustainability and economic impact.
The Women in Business Empowerment Programme is offered exclusively to women entrepreneurs who are CIB clients, integrating non-financial services with tailored financial solutions to support business growth.
As part of the programme, CIB provides a range of banking products and services, including credit cards, business financing facilities on preferential terms and innovative funding solutions.

Yasser Abdallah, Deputy CEO for Retail and Commercial Banking at CIB, said the programme reflects the Bank’s strategic approach to women’s empowerment. “Supporting women entrepreneurs is not merely a social responsibility; it is a strategic investment in a more inclusive and sustainable future. Through our partnership with the EBRD, we are building an integrated ecosystem of non-financial services that aligns with the ambitions of businesswomen and equips them with practical tools to grow and compete with confidence.”
Hany El-Deeb, Head of Small and Medium Enterprises and Commercial Banking at CIB, said the initiative goes beyond access to finance. “The programme focuses on capacity building alongside financing, covering critical areas such as management, financial literacy and business development. This holistic approach enables women-led businesses to achieve both financial and non-financial objectives, strengthening their contribution to a more inclusive and sustainable economy.”
The first phase of the programme will focus on marketing strategies and brand building, with additional specialised tracks to be rolled out across multiple disciplines over the coming year.

El-Husseiny noted that the programme builds on the EBRD’s longstanding support for women entrepreneurs, adding that CIB continues to reinforce its position as a leading bank in delivering non-financial services tailored to the needs of women in business.
He added that investing in women’s empowerment is a cornerstone of sustainable development and economic growth, stressing that the programme reflects the EBRD’s vision of translating empowerment into lasting impact by supporting women at different stages of their professional journey.

Speaking at a conference on economic competitiveness, Al-Mashat stated that reforms supporting growth and employment “will not cease” as the country transitions from managing challenges to consolidating stability.
To support fiscal discipline, the minister noted that the government adhered to an investment spending ceiling of EGP 1trn in the 2024/25 fiscal year. Preliminary indicators showed actual public investments amounted to EGP 922bn, representing 92% of the target.
Al-Mashat said this governance of public investment has reduced burdens on the general budget and debt, creating space for the private sector to increase its share to 63% of total investments in the current fiscal year.
“Economic policy has become more predictable, enhancing the confidence of the business community and investors,” Al-Mashat said, adding that “2026 will witness a different shift for the Egyptian economy”.
Concessional financing provided to the private sector since 2020 has exceeded $15bn, according to the minister. This included $5bn through the “NWFE” energy programme, which provided financing to companies including Infinity Power, AMEA Power, ACWA Power, and Scatec.
Looking ahead, Al-Mashat said the ministry is working with the Ministry of Finance to prepare the Economic and Social Development Plan and a Medium-Term Budget Framework for 2026/27–2029/30. This will be linked to performance methodologies to ensure spending efficiency.
The minister added that the coming period will see €1.8bn in additional financing through the European Investment Guarantee mechanism, alongside further equity investments by international institutions.
Regarding structural changes, Al-Mashat said the state is continuing labour market reforms and has adopted a unified definition for start-ups to allow companies to benefit from government incentives.

Speaking on Tuesday at the Conference on the Competitiveness of the Egyptian Economy in Cairo, Sawiris said an Italian company has expressed interest in forming a consortium with one of his affiliated firms to bid for the management and operation of Hurghada International Airport, which the government has recently offered to private investors.
Sawiris said he is also open to competing for the management of other airports if they are offered, particularly Luxor and Sohag airports.
He added that upgrading and professionally managing airports, alongside other incentives supporting the tourism sector, could help double the number of tourists visiting Egypt in the coming years.
Sawiris also outlined his investment plans for the next phase, which include new projects in Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq.
“We are looking to acquire a new plot of land in the UAE following the major success of my first project there, with investments of $15bn,” Sawiris said.
Beyond the UAE, he added that his group aims to transfer its experience in replacing traditional tuk-tuks in Egypt with electric alternatives to Morocco. “We seek to replicate the model by replacing diesel-powered motorcycles with electric ones,” he said.
In Egypt, Sawiris said future expansions are likely to focus on the tourism sector. He plans to develop three hotels in the Giza Pyramids area and in the governorates of Minya and Sohag.
He ruled out launching new real estate developments, noting that his company is currently focused on completing existing projects.
Sawiris also renewed his criticism of high interest rates in Egypt, describing them as harmful to the sector. He said interest costs account for roughly half the cost of real estate projects in the country.",310,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.5775660276412964,2025-12-17T09:31:46.418227

The agreement was signed by Mohamed Medhat, Deputy CEO of MSMEDA, and Ahmed Labib, Managing Director and CEO of Reefy, in the presence of Basel Rahmy, CEO of MSMEDA.
Rahmy said the Agency is expanding financing for micro projects due to their vital role in creating job opportunities across productive, agricultural, and service sectors. He noted that MSMEDA is keen to cooperate with specialised institutions with proven expertise in microfinance, given their ability to reach target groups across all governorates, villages, and hamlets, and effectively meet their financing needs. This approach, he added, has contributed to increasing the number of funded projects.
Rahmy stressed MSMEDA’s commitment to implementing the State’s direction and the directives of Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, Chairperson of the Agency’s Board, to scale up financing for micro projects in light of their importance in generating employment opportunities, particularly for young people.
He explained that cooperation with Reefy aims to channel financing through the company’s network of 220 branches nationwide, supporting citizens and youth in establishing new micro projects, as well as enabling existing businesses to develop, expand, replace, or renew their activities through access to funding. This, he said, contributes to improving living standards for both project owners and workers.
Rahmy added that financing for a single project can reach up to EGP 266,000, depending on funding requirements, noting that the agreement is expected to finance around 3,000 micro projects across various governorates.
For his part, Ahmed Labib said the agreement aligns with the State’s efforts to enhance financial inclusion and integrate vulnerable groups who do not engage with the banking sector into the formal financial system, thereby supporting sustainable economic development.
Labib added that Reefy is working to expand access to financial services, particularly in villages, rural areas, and Upper Egypt, with a special focus on women and young people. This, he said, supports the State’s vision of empowering micro enterprises and increasing their contribution to the national economy.",351,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8935662508010864,2025-12-17T09:33:08.319485

He said the Ministry is currently working on the launch of a unified digital business platform that will integrate company incorporation, licensing, payments, and financial and customs obligations into a single, comprehensive system.
The platform is designed to significantly reduce the number of procedures and the time required to complete them, enhance transparency and efficiency, and strengthen trust between the State and investors.
El-Khatib made the remarks during a forum organised by Lynx Consulting, attended by Mohamed El-Gouski, Assistant Minister of Investment and Foreign Trade for Planning, Development, and Digital Transformation; Amani El-Wassal, Head of the Agreements and Foreign Trade Sector; Mohamed Hanafi, Managing Director of Lynx Consulting; Moataz Yaken, an expert on Egyptian economic affairs; alongside senior ministry officials, business leaders, investors, and private-sector representatives.
During the forum, El-Khatib outlined Egypt’s strategy to improve the investment and trade environment, expand exports to African markets, and enhance trade competitiveness. He highlighted the government’s vision and forward-looking plans to achieve these objectives.
The Minister said Egypt has laid solid foundations in recent years to build a more competitive economy, noting that the government has adopted economic policies characterised by stability and transparency. These policies, he explained, enable investors to make informed decisions with confidence, while providing a clear understanding of the State’s direction and its executive and institutional framework.
On monetary policy, El-Khatib said the primary objective has been to curb inflation and restore monetary discipline. These efforts have borne fruit, with inflation declining to around 11.6% in June 2025. Foreign currency reserves have risen to $50bn, while net foreign assets have shifted from a deficit to a surplus exceeding $10bn.
Regarding fiscal policy, he said the State has focused on rebuilding confidence, easing financial pressures on investors, and improving tax revenues through enhanced collection efficiency and an expanded tax base. These measures resulted in a 35% increase in tax revenues without imposing any new burdens.
El-Khatib also stressed that Egypt has adopted a trade policy based on greater openness to global markets. Reforms have reduced customs clearance time and costs by 65%, with plans to reach a 90% reduction in the coming period, cutting average clearance time to just two days. He added that the removal of several non-tariff barriers has saved the Egyptian economy more than $1.5bn during the current year.
The Minister highlighted Egypt’s key competitive advantages, including low production costs, a large and skilled workforce, advanced infrastructure, and a strategic geographic location. These strengths, he said, reinforce confidence in the economy’s ability to achieve higher and sustainable growth rates with tangible benefits for citizens.
For his part, Mohamed El-Gouski outlined the Ministry’s plans to deepen trade integration with Africa through regional agreements and economic blocs such as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and COMESA. He also highlighted efforts to strengthen the role of commercial representation offices across African markets and to optimise the use of Jisr Company’s assets.
El-Gouski said the Ministry initially targeted increasing trade exchange with selected African countries based on clearly defined criteria linked to each country’s competitive advantages.
He added that the Ministry has worked to address challenges facing trade expansion in Africa by developing maritime and land connectivity supported by logistics zones; coordinating with the Central Bank of Egypt to strengthen the presence of Egyptian banks on the continent; utilising export rebate programmes to support Egyptian companies; organising trade missions and permanent exhibitions across Africa; and enhancing institutional coordination by unifying the roles of entities involved in foreign trade.
The forum concluded with an extensive interactive discussion addressing key issues related to boosting Egypt’s export competitiveness, policy frameworks, and private-sector perspectives. Participants also explored opportunities to expand exports to Africa, required logistics and financing solutions, and ways to promote sustainable and green exports in line with the standards of emerging African markets.",665,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9104154706001282,2025-12-18T09:30:17.360940

Backed by 43 development partners, the replenishment reflects a 23% increase over the previous cycle, achieved despite tight global fiscal conditions and shrinking aid budgets. The outcome underscores renewed confidence in Africa’s development trajectory and in the African Development Bank Group’s leadership and evolving financing approach.
“This is not just a replenishment—it is a turning point,” said Sidi Ould Tah, President of the African Development Bank Group. “In one of the most challenging global environments for development finance, our partners chose ambition over retrenchment, and investment over inertia.”
For the first time in the ADF’s history, 23 African countries contributed directly, pledging a combined $182.7m—five times the level of the previous cycle. Nineteen countries contributed for the first time, alongside long-standing regional supporters.
“This is transformational,” Ould Tah said. “Africa is no longer only a beneficiary of concessional finance. Africa is a co-investor in its own future.”
ADF-17 introduces a significant shift in how concessional resources are deployed. Partners endorsed a new financial framework enabling the Fund to leverage its balance sheet, operationalise a Market Borrowing Option, employ innovative instruments such as hybrid capital, and use concessional resources to absorb risk and crowd in private investment.
Currently, every dollar invested through the Fund mobilises more than $2.50 in co-financing and private capital—a ratio expected to increase under the new model.
“This enables concessional finance to do what it does best—absorb risk, unlock private capital and accelerate development at scale,” Ould Tah added.
ADF-17 also anchors a new generation of scaled, risk-sharing partnerships. Major commitments include up to $800m from the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) and up to $2bn from the OPEC Fund for International Development, significantly enhancing the Fund’s ability to drive transformational projects in difficult operating environments.
Resources mobilised under ADF-17 will support 37 low-income and fragile African countries, with priorities including energy access, food system resilience, human capital, regional integration and trade, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Targeted support will continue for countries facing fragility and vulnerability, including through the Transition Support Facility.
The record replenishment positions the African Development Fund at the centre of a new era of African ownership, risk-sharing and investment-driven development, further reinforcing its role as a catalyst for sustainable growth across the continent.",413,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8426740765571594,2025-12-18T09:30:34.861373

Chief among the approvals was the granting of Golden Licenses to two strategic projects worth a combined EGP 15.1bn.
The first was awarded to MAC for Light Transport Manufacturing to establish an integrated automotive complex in New October City, adjacent to the 6th of October Dry Port. The EGP 6.3bn project will encompass the production and assembly of passenger cars, light and medium transport vehicles, buses, components, spare parts, tyres, and painting facilities.
The project is expected to generate around 1,000 jobs, achieve a local component share starting at 42%, export at least half of its output, and commence operations by early 2027—supporting the state’s drive to localise automotive manufacturing and advance electric mobility.
A second Golden License was granted to Deli Egypt for Industry to establish a factory for office supplies, school tools and children’s sports products in 10th of Ramadan City. Valued at EGP 8.8bn, the facility marks the global Deli Group’s first investment in Egypt and is projected to create 2,200 jobs. The project is expected to source more than 50% of its inputs locally and export at least 50% of production, with completion slated for February 2027.
In the energy sector, the Cabinet approved a draft presidential decree for a new petroleum exploration and production agreement in the Integrated Badr El-Din area in the Western Desert, with minimum investments of $208 million. Plans include drilling 44 wells and targeting monthly output of 105,000 barrels of oil and 1.2bn cubic feet of gas—reducing Egypt’s import bill by an estimated $25m per month.
The Cabinet also endorsed a $10m grant from the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development to finance projects in Sohag, and a $4.3m grant from South Korea to support green-energy infrastructure in the Suez Canal—covering LNG bunkering and training facilities—aligned with efforts to develop a sustainable canal corridor by 2030.
Additional approvals covered Egypt’s hosting of the 24th Conference of the Parties to the Barcelona Convention, accession to the D-8 Preferential Trade Agreement, land allocation in Sadat City for logistics development, authorisation of commemorative gold and silver coins marking 150 years of the State Lawsuits Authority, and updated compensation rates for public contracts.

Speaking at a weekly press conference, Madbouly stated that non-oil exports recorded approximately $40bn in 2024. He affirmed that the national target to increase total exports—including both goods and services—to $145bn by 2030 is achievable in terms of both timing and volume.
The Prime Minister highlighted that the country has recorded its lowest trade deficit in the last ten years, attributing this improvement to the government’s ongoing coordination with export councils to resolve challenges facing exporters.
Investment and Industry
Madbouly announced that the government is finalising a new package of investment facilities and incentives, which President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi is expected to announce soon. These measures aim to improve the investment climate and support the competitiveness of the Egyptian economy.
Regarding the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE), Madbouly noted that the zone has recently attracted investments worth $13.5bn. He singled out the Qantara West area as a promising model, with exports from the zone projected to exceed $4 billion in the coming period.
Poverty and Social Impact
Addressing social indicators, Madbouly revealed that the latest official statistics show approximately 29% of Egyptians live below the poverty line.
He acknowledged that economic reform programmes implemented to strengthen the national economy had contributed to a “slight increase” in this percentage. However, he stated that the state is working to mitigate the social impact of these reforms by lowering prices of food products and commodities, while ensuring a stable environment for investors.
Madbouly promised a “qualitative leap” in the level of services provided to citizens in the coming years as part of the state’s comprehensive development plans.
Economic Context
The Prime Minister described 2024 as an “exceptional year by all measures” regarding economic difficulties, particularly affecting the real estate, home appliances, and durable goods markets. He argued that discussions on economic recession must be contextualised, noting that inflation is a global phenomenon affecting even the most advanced nations.
Separately, Madbouly highlighted the involvement of Italian energy group Eni in supporting Egypt’s healthcare infrastructure. He said the company’s work establishing advanced medical facilities reflects a shared vision between the state and its international partners to prioritise human development and health.",388,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9487179517745972,2025-12-18T09:30:51.351016

The Group also unveiled nearly $500m in new investments and strategic partnerships in the manufacturing of home appliances, electronics and related components, in cooperation with leading global companies.
The new partnerships include Japan’s Sharp and Hitachi, Italy’s La Germania and Hoover, and China’s TCL, alongside ElAraby Group’s own brands: Egypt’s Tornado, Japan’s Kajitsu and Germany’s Heller.
ElAraby explained that ending its contracts with Toshiba in the home appliances and television sectors is part of the natural evolution of the global business landscape and reflects the Group’s restructuring of its international partnerships.
The company affirmed its full commitment to maintaining after-sales services for all products sold under ElAraby’s warranty, stressing that its dedication to customer service remains unchanged regardless of partnership changes or investment strategies.
The Group emphasised that its success over more than six decades has never been dependent on a single brand. It highlighted the establishment of the largest research and development centre in the Middle East—with investments exceeding EGP 3bn—dedicated to designing and developing home appliances and electronics for both domestic manufacturers and major global brands.
ElAraby noted that its growth in recent years, both in local industrial expansion and in forging new international partnerships, includes major agreements and projects approaching $500m in home appliance manufacturing.

He noted that the business climate is steadily improving and invited local and international partners to expand their investments in Egypt.
Speaking at a meeting with members of the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kouchouk said the government is targeting investment across productive, export-led and technology-driven sectors, with the aim of positioning Egypt as a regional hub for production and exports. He added that the Ministry is working to reduce the debt of budgetary entities to below 80% of GDP by June 2026, noting that a clearly defined and more ambitious strategy is underway to improve government debt indicators. This strategy, he explained, is based on innovative financing tools and strengthened coordination among state institutions.
Kouchouk highlighted the private sector’s proven capacity for competitiveness and its leading role in driving economic momentum. He pointed to a 73% increase in private investment last year, reflecting the injection of billions of Egyptian pounds into productive projects.
“We have chosen a path based on trust and partnership with the tax community, and we are continuing to simplify procedures to encourage voluntary compliance,” he said. He noted that a 35% increase in tax revenues last year was achieved without imposing new burdens, reflecting stronger economic activity and a positive response from the private sector.
The Minister stressed that the government is working to create additional fiscal space to strengthen social protection, increase allocations for human development, expand social spending, and direct resources to key sectors such as healthcare and the treatment of critical cases.
“I would like to thank the private sector. Together, we are moving in the right direction to enhance the competitiveness of our economy,” Kouchouk concluded.
For his part, Eric Chevallier, the French Ambassador to Egypt, said ongoing tax and customs reforms are reinforcing a climate of trust and partnership with international investors. He noted that the Egyptian economy is moving in a positive direction, with improving growth and declining inflation, and highlighted government support for expanding the global reach of Egyptian exports.
Meanwhile, Emad El-Sonbaty, Chairman of the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Egypt, expressed his appreciation to the Minister for his commitment to maintaining dialogue with the French business community as part of wider efforts to strengthen partnerships with local and foreign investors.
El-Sonbaty said the business community is looking forward to greater clarity and stability in fiscal and tax policy, continued simplification of administrative procedures, accelerated digital transformation, and the preservation of institutionalised dialogue with the private sector.

The platform is designed to provide a secure digital system for property exports, ensuring transparency and investor protection through a unified regulatory framework. Madbouly stated that the government is prioritising real estate investment to sustain high growth rates in the sector and meet rising international demand.
The first phase of the platform features more than 3,000 units in New Alamein City, all of which have been issued unique real estate identification numbers. Communications and Information Technology Minister Amr Talaat said the system is linked to the national property registry to verify ownership and prevent fraudulent transactions.
“The platform aims to regulate property exports through a unified framework, achieving transparency and credibility by providing a clear and organised market,” Talaat said. He added that future phases would expand geographically to include the New Administrative Capital, New Mansoura, New Rashid, Sawari, and Sheikh Zayed.
Housing Minister Sherif El-Sherbiny confirmed that the ministry has coordinated with the Central Bank of Egypt Governor to establish mechanisms for opening and managing bank accounts for developers. This move aims to regulate financial flows related to property sales to foreign buyers.
Minister of Justice Adnan Fangari said a draft resolution on real estate transactions has been prepared to include all necessary facilities for buyers. He noted that the ministry’s involvement provides a guarantee to international purchasers against the multiple sale of single units.
Investment and Foreign Trade Minister Hassan El-Khatib noted that the country is well-positioned to attract significant investment in the sector. He highlighted ongoing government efforts to streamline residency permits and property registration processes for those purchasing through the platform.

2025-12-19,From Miami Sands to Brussels Boardrooms: The High-Stakes Gambit for Ukraine’s Future,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/19/from-miami-sands-to-brussels-boardrooms-the-high-stakes-gambit-for-ukraines-future/,"As the winter sun sets over Miami this weekend, a series of discreet meetings in the Florida heat may well determine the fate of a frozen conflict thousands of miles away. While holidaymakers occupy the beaches, envoys from Washington, Moscow, and Kyiv are converging on the city, marking a clandestine but critical chapter in the effort to end the war in Ukraine.
Contents
The Miami Connection
The Brussels Standoff
Putin’s Frontline Pressure
A Broader European Horizon
The diplomatic flurry comes at a moment of extreme volatility. In Moscow, President Vladimir Putin is projecting a position of strength, insisting his forces hold the “strategic initiative” across the entire front line. Meanwhile, in Brussels, European leaders are locked in what has been described as a “last chance” summit to prevent Ukraine’s economy from collapsing under the weight of a looming €71.7bn budget deficit.
By the time the European Council concludes its two-day session on Friday, the central question of the conflict will have shifted from whether a deal is possible to who will pay for it and what guarantees will remain. This convergence of Trump-led diplomacy in the United States and financial desperation in Europe represents the most significant pivot in the war’s trajectory since the 2022 war, as the international community tests the viability of a ceasefire against the harsh realities of territorial concessions and frozen billions.
The Miami Connection
Kirill Dmitriev, an envoy for President Putin, is expected to arrive in Miami on Sunday for talks with US President-elect Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and his advisor and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. According to sources familiar with the arrangements reported by
Axios
, the meeting aims to brief the Russian side on progress made during recent discussions between US and Ukrainian officials.
Parallel to this, a Ukrainian delegation led by National Security Council Secretary Rustem Umerov is also expected in Miami this week. While no trilateral meeting is currently planned, the proximity of the actors suggests a “shuttle diplomacy” approach. The talks follow intensive negotiations in Berlin, where the framework of the Trump peace plan began to evolve from a proposal that initially shocked Kyiv with demands for territorial concessions to one now focused on “NATO-style” security guarantees.
“For the first time since 2022, a ceasefire is possible,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz noted during a recent press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is expected to brief EU leaders on the progress of these American-led talks.
The Brussels Standoff
Across the Atlantic, the atmosphere is considerably more strained. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has staked her reputation on a breakthrough regarding Ukraine’s funding. “I will not leave the Council without a solution for Ukraine’s financing,” she told reporters as she arrived in Brussels.
The primary obstacle is €210bn in frozen Russian assets, the vast majority of which are held in the Brussels-based financial institution Euroclear. The EU hopes to use these assets as collateral for a massive loan to Kyiv. However, Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever remains resistant, fearing legal retaliation from Moscow and financial instability.
The internal divisions are stark. Italy, Bulgaria, and Malta have expressed reservations, while Belgium’s ambassador reportedly told his counterparts that the country is “stepping backwards” from the proposal. If a consensus on assets fails, the EU is considering a “Plan B”: issuing joint debt backed by the EU budget. This path would likely exclude Hungary and Slovakia, allowing 25 of the 27 member states to move forward independently.
Putin’s Frontline Pressure
While diplomats haggle over interest rates and security clauses, Vladimir Putin used his annual “Results of the Year” press conference to signal that Russia remains unmoved by Western pressure. He claimed his forces are advancing rapidly toward Zaporizhzhia and have secured “full control” of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region.
“The Russian army holds the strategic initiative in its entirety,” Putin said, adding that the capture of Pokrovsk (referred to by Moscow as Krasnoarmeysk) is “extremely important” for launching further offensive operations.
Despite his aggressive military posture, Putin offered a rare nod to Donald Trump, stating the US President-elect is making “sincere efforts” to end the war. However, the Russian leader remained firm on the ground reality: “The ball is in the court of the West and Ukraine.”
A Broader European Horizon
The summit in Brussels is not merely a war council; it is a test of European resilience in a changing global order. Beyond the immediate crisis in Ukraine, leaders are grappling with:
Economic Competitiveness:
Responding to aggressive trade policies from both the US and China, particularly regarding rare earth minerals.
Expansion:
Pushing forward the membership bids of Western Balkan nations, with Montenegro aiming for accession by 2028.
The Mercosur Hurdle:
Navigating French and Italian opposition to a long-delayed trade deal with South American nations, which Denmark hopes to sign by December 20.
As the summit nears its conclusion, the draft recommendations suggest the EU will commit to “strong and credible security guarantees” for Ukraine. It is a phrase intended to reassure Kyiv that even if Washington pursues a separate peace, Brussels will not retreat.
The “kicker” remains the timeline. With Ukraine facing a cash shortfall as early as April, the diplomatic theatre playing out from the sun-drenched offices of Miami to the late-night corridors of Brussels is no longer a matter of policy—it is a race against the spring thaw.",891,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.6778974533081055,2025-12-20T09:22:48.864322
2025-09-23,Cityscape 2025: Unlocking Egypt’s real estate potential,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/09/23/cityscape-2025-unlocking-egypts-real-estate-potential/,"As Egypt’s real estate sector faces rapid transformation, strong demand continues to intersect with financing challenges, urban expansion, and the rise of new investment models. At the forefront of this evolution is Cityscape 2025—positioned not just as a real estate exhibition, but as a strategic platform to drive dialogue, innovation, and investment.
In this interview, Hany Khafagy, General Manager of Informa Egypt, discusses how Cityscape is enabling growth in the sector and outlines the opportunities and challenges shaping the future of Egyptian real estate.
Does Egypt’s real estate sector need more incentives to drive growth?
Egypt’s real estate market holds tremendous growth potential, but it does require more targeted incentives. These include improved financing mechanisms, streamlined property registration, and stronger support for exporting real estate abroad. Cityscape 2025 directly addresses these needs through initiatives like Cityscape Talks for policy dialogue, the Egypt PropTech Challenge to support startups, and the International Pavilion to connect with a broader investor base. These tools are critical in sustaining momentum and driving growth in key areas such as the New Administrative Capital, New Cairo, and the North Coast.
What is the significance of Cityscape 2025 for Egypt?
Cityscape is more than an exhibition—it’s a global platform that reflects Egypt’s urban transformation. It showcases milestone developments in cities like the New Administrative Capital, New Alamein, and the North Coast. More importantly, it positions Egypt as a top real estate investment destination, encouraging foreign investment and promoting real estate exports. The event also strengthens collaboration between developers, investors, and government entities, signaling confidence in the sector as a pillar of national economic growth.
How would you assess the current state of Egypt’s real estate sector, especially amid rising prices?
Despite economic fluctuations and recent price hikes driven by local and global pressures, demand for real estate in Egypt remains strong. The sector continues to be viewed as a safe and stable investment—by Egyptians, expatriates, and regional investors alike. New urban developments like the New Administrative Capital and New Alamein offer a wide range of residential, commercial, and tourism options, catering to diverse market needs. This sustained demand underscores the sector’s resilience and long-term potential.
How can Egypt capitalize on the current real estate boom to shape the sector’s future?
This boom is a strategic opportunity to build a more sustainable and innovative real estate sector. By focusing on smart urban planning, integrated infrastructure, and tech-driven development, Egypt can unlock long-term value. Attracting foreign capital, expanding real estate exports, and introducing innovative financing models will further strengthen the sector’s role in economic development and solidify Egypt’s position on the global real estate map.
Hany Khafagy
Has the sector become more resilient, or have companies simply adapted to new realities?
It’s a combination of both. The real estate sector has proven to be highly resilient, supported by strong underlying demand. At the same time, developers have adapted by embracing new financing tools and shifting toward more integrated, lifestyle-oriented communities. There’s also a growing emphasis on smart technologies, sustainability, and flexible offerings—all of which enhance the sector’s ability to weather economic challenges. Cityscape 2025 contributes significantly by showcasing these solutions and facilitating dialogue that helps align the industry with global trends.
Is competition in the sector pushing developers to offer more customer-centric solutions?
Absolutely. Intense competition is driving developers to become more creative and responsive. We’re seeing extended payment plans, more flexible financing options, and exclusive offers during events like Cityscape. These initiatives not only give customers better choices, but also help maintain strong sales activity—even in uncertain economic times. In the end, this competition raises the bar for the entire sector.
What are the key topics that will be addressed at Cityscape Talks 2025?
Cityscape Talks 2025 will spotlight the most pressing and promising issues in Egypt’s real estate landscape. Discussions will cover landmark projects like the New Administrative Capital and Ras El Hekma, while exploring themes such as property pricing, financing mechanisms, investment trends, and PropTech innovation. Industry leaders, developers, policymakers, and investors will offer insights and practical strategies to drive the sector forward.
What advice would you give to real estate buyers and industry players?
For buyers, the key is to assess your needs and financial capabilities carefully before making a purchase. Look beyond short-term offers and focus on long-term value. For developers, it’s crucial to design products that resonate with new market segments—especially younger generations—and to maintain pricing strategies aligned with real purchasing power. Flexibility, innovation, and a deep understanding of evolving customer expectations will be essential for long-term success.",754,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.5719684362411499,2025-12-20T09:23:20.992458

Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation Minister Rania Al-Mashat and Local Development Minister Manal Awad, who is also acting Environment Minister, inspected the facility alongside Sohag Governor Abdul Fattah Serag. The visit focused on the Al-Radwan International Engineering Industries factory, which represents a $5m investment on a 5,000-square-metre site, producing compressors with capacities ranging from 1/10 to 3/4 horsepower.
Project officials stated that the plant currently operates with 40% local components, with plans to increase this to 70% to reduce the national import bill. Governor Serag noted that the project aims to meet domestic demand and export to markets including Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Sudan, Yemen, and Libya.
The West Gerga industrial zone spans 1,089 acres and is located 8km from Sohag International Airport and 50km from Sohag city. It currently houses 223 factories with an occupancy rate of 94.7%. Industrial Development Authority representatives reported that general infrastructure development at the site cost EGP 633m, while integrated utility networks—including water, sewage, electricity, telecommunications, natural gas, and fire systems—accounted for an additional EGP 605m.
The zone includes a complex for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) featuring 178 units that provide approximately 2,000 direct jobs. Its first phase covers 270 acres across 248 plots dedicated to engineering, mining, building materials, textiles, and ready-made garments. An additional 64-acre northern expansion is currently being equipped with utilities.
Minister Al-Mashat said the project reflects the state’s strategy to establish integrated industrial infrastructure and increasethe contribution of Upper Egypt governorates to the gross domestic product. She added that the Local Development Program in Upper Egypt (PLDUE) aligns with the “National Narrative for Economic Development and International Cooperation” to promote growth and job creation through sectoral interventions and production clusters.
Minister Awad highlighted that the PLDUE has injected approximately EGP 1.6bn into the West Gerga zone. She noted that these investments have improved occupancy rates and the quality of industries by leveraging the zone’s proximity to the Western Desert Road and the high-speed electric rail line. Awad stated that current infrastructure investments would also serve a planned 500-acre expansion.
The delegation included Hisham El-Helbawy, Assistant Minister of Local Development and Director of the PLDUE, Ahmed El-Sayes, the governorate’s Secretary General, and Mohamed Helmy, the Assistant Secretary General, alongside other executive and local leaders.
Governor Serag concluded that the efforts are part of a state vision to enhance integrated development in Upper Egypt and create a supportive environment for investment and sustainable employment for the governorate’s residents.",454,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7365986108779907,2025-12-20T09:23:51.388388

The milestone reflects CIB’s ongoing commitment to nurturing young talent and promoting the exchange of banking expertise between Egypt and Kenya.
The programme is being implemented as part of a strategic partnership between Commercial International Bank and the Kenya Bankers Association, established under a memorandum of understanding signed at the beginning of 2025. The agreement aims to develop Kenyan youth and empower the next generation of financial professionals, contributing to the creation of highly skilled banking cadres capable of shaping the future of Africa’s financial sector.
Spanning six consecutive months, the third edition of the programme delivered intensive, specialized training covering core banking principles, with a strong focus on credit fundamentals and technology-driven banking solutions. Participants also received hands-on training in credit analysis, risk assessment, and sound lending decision-making, equipping them with practical skills aligned with international banking standards.
A total of 22 young professionals from Kenya successfully completed all stages of the programme, qualifying them to make a meaningful contribution to the banking and financial services market in East Africa. The graduates are expected to play an active role in strengthening institutional capabilities and supporting sustainable growth within the sector.
The initiative reflects CIB’s expanding footprint and strategic presence in Kenya since its entry into the market in 2020. It also aligns with the broader efforts of the Egyptian State, led by the Central Bank of Egypt, to promote African banking integration, enhance financial sector cooperation, and invest in human capital development through the transfer of expertise and knowledge sharing.
The programme concluded with an official graduation ceremony held in Nairobi, attended by representatives from CIB’s executive management in both Egypt and Kenya, alongside senior officials from the Kenya Bankers Association, representatives of the Central Bank of Kenya, and members of the Egyptian Embassy in Nairobi.

Abdallah made the remarks while attending the signing ceremony of a partnership agreement between the Fund and Misr Life Insurance Company to implement the “Misr Ma‘akom” initiative. The initiative aims to provide comprehensive financial support for the minor children of martyrs, victims, and those injured in military, terrorist, and security operations from the Armed Forces and the Police.
The ceremony was attended by El-Sayed El-Ghaly, Chairperson of the Board of Trustees of the Fund; Mohamed Farid, Chairperson of the Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA); and senior officials from the Central Bank of Egypt, the FRA, the Fund, and Misr Life Insurance Company.
The agreement was signed by Ahmed Mohamed El-Ashaal, Executive Director of the Fund for Honouring Martyrs, and Mostafa El-Qammash, Managing Director and CEO of Misr Life Insurance Company.
The initiative is being launched in line with directives from President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, reflecting the Egyptian State’s firm commitment to supporting the families of martyrs, victims, and the injured, in recognition of the sacrifices they made to safeguard the nation’s security and stability.
Speaking at the event, CBE Governor Hassan Abdallah said the “Misr Ma‘akom” initiative embodies the State’s deep appreciation for those who gave their lives or were injured in defense of Egypt. He stressed that special attention is being given to minor children and injured minors to ensure they receive comprehensive and sustainable support.

He explained that implementation of the “Misr Ma‘akom” initiative will commence on 1 January 2026. Disbursements will be made to beneficiaries once they reach the age of 21, ensuring long-term financial security and stability.
Under the initiative’s framework, beneficiaries who reach the age of 21 by 30 June will receive their payments during the first week of July, while those who turn 21 by 31 December will receive their payments in the first week of January. El-Ghaly added that, God forbid, any new cases included in the Fund in the future will be enrolled in the initiative immediately and granted the same benefits.

According to a joint statement from Egypt’s Ministries of Industry and Transport, the meeting took place within the framework of the longstanding and brotherly relations between Egypt and the United Republic of Tanzania, in line with President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi’s directives to strengthen cooperation with African nations.
Al-Wazir met with Tanzanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mahmoud Thabit Kombo and Minister of Information, Culture and Sports Professor Yalamma Gamba John Kabudi, in the presence of senior officials from Egypt’s ministries of industry, transport, and foreign affairs.
During the talks, Al-Wazir reaffirmed Egypt’s commitment to expanding cooperation with Tanzania across various sectors, particularly industry and transport, emphasizing that bilateral relations are rooted in strong historical ties and close political relations between President Al-Sisi and Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan. He stressed that the proposed cooperation is based on integration rather than competition.
Key initiatives discussed included the establishment of a cargo terminal at Dar es Salaam Port through Egyptian companies, leveraging global shipping lines to enhance trade flows between the two countries.
The discussions also covered plans to develop an integrated livestock breeding complex, a modern slaughterhouse, and a leather tanning factory, alongside specialized facilities to improve production management and marketing efficiency.
These projects aim to increase the flow of Egyptian raw materials and manufactured goods to Tanzania, while facilitating the import of Tanzanian products into Egypt through major ports, including Sokhna, Safaga, and Dar es Salaam.
Both sides also explored the reciprocal establishment of logistics zones—one for Egypt in Tanzania and another for Tanzania in Egypt—modeled on Egypt’s successful experience with Rwanda. The initiative is expected to support joint investments, promote industrial cooperation, strengthen economic integration, and create employment opportunities for youth in both countries.
Al-Wazir highlighted Egypt’s extensive experience in infrastructure development, noting that Egyptian companies have delivered major projects domestically and internationally, including roads, bridges, airports, tunnels, and large-scale national developments. He affirmed their readiness to implement projects in Tanzania to the highest quality standards, within short timelines, and at competitive costs.
For his part, Tanzanian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo expressed appreciation for Egypt’s role in advancing bilateral cooperation, praising Egyptian expertise in industry, transport, infrastructure, and agriculture. He said the discussions paved the way for moving forward with the implementation of the proposed projects, which are expected to generate significant economic returns and employment opportunities.
Kombo added that steps will be taken in the coming period to finalize project frameworks, extending an official invitation to Al-Wazir to visit Tanzania for meetings with ministers of agriculture, transport, industry, and investment to formally launch and activate the projects.
Meanwhile, Minister of Information, Culture and Sports Professor Yalamma Gamba John Kabudi welcomed the outcomes of the meeting, emphasizing the strength of Egyptian-Tanzanian relations and affirming Tanzania’s full readiness to proceed with the joint initiatives, with intensified coordination expected in the period ahead.",512,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8064846992492676,2025-12-21T09:23:29.240519
2025-12-20,"Outstanding consumer finance hits EGP 74.9bn in 10M 2025, up 61.6% YoY: EFCF",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/20/outstanding-consumer-finance-hits-egp-74-9bn-in-10m-2025-up-61-6-yoy-efcf/,"The Egyptian consumer finance sector recorded unprecedented growth during the first 10 months of 2025, with outstanding balances reaching EGP 74.9bn, a year-on-year increase of 61.6%, according to the Egyptian Federation for Consumer Finance (EFCF). The strong performance reflects accelerating demand for regulated consumer credit, a sharp expansion in the customer base, and the continued maturity of the sector’s regulatory and risk-management framework.
Outstanding balances rose from EGP 47.4bn during the same period in 2024, marking growth of nearly 58%. Meanwhile, the number of consumers benefiting from licensed consumer finance companies surged from 3.27 million to 9.25 million, an increase of 182% year on year. The Federation attributed this rapid expansion to improved digital infrastructure, a broader and more diversified range of financing products, and rising confidence in the sector’s governance and supervisory environment.
Despite this exceptional growth, portfolio quality remained sound. Default rates were maintained at a stable 3-4%, underscoring the sector’s ability to scale responsibly while preserving disciplined credit standards. The EFCF described consumer finance as one of Egypt’s most regulated and resilient non-bank financial activities, playing an increasingly vital role in supporting household purchasing power and expanding access to formal financial services.
Growth under a robust regulatory framework
The Federation emphasized that the sector’s expansion is taking place within a well-defined regulatory structure overseen by the Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA). This framework has enabled consumer finance companies to respond to rising demand while ensuring transparency, consumer protection, and prudent risk management.
“These results confirm that consumer finance has evolved into a mature, well-supervised activity capable of meeting essential consumer needs without compromising stability,” the Federation said in a statement. It added that the sector has become a key pillar in Egypt’s broader financial inclusion strategy, particularly for first-time borrowers and underserved segments of the population.
The announcements were made during a press conference organized by the EFCF and attended by senior industry leaders, including Saeed Zaater, Chairperson of the Federation; Osama Farid, CEO of Premium Card; Ahmed Osama, Managing Director of Drive Finance; and Ali Abdel Wahab, Executive Director of Consumer Finance at B.TECH. All four executives are members of the Federation’s Board of Directors.
The speakers reviewed recent market developments, discussed regulatory priorities, and outlined the sector’s readiness for deeper digitalization and the phased adoption of Basel III capital adequacy standards.
Law No. 18 of 2020 reshaped the market
Saeed Zaater, Chairman of the Egyptian Federation for Consumer Finance, said that the sector’s transformation over recent years has been driven primarily by Law No. 18 of 2020, which laid the foundation for a transparent and rules-based consumer finance market.
“Law No. 18 of 2020 fundamentally reshaped the activity, moving it from an environment characterized by unstructured practices to a comprehensive regulatory framework,” Zaater said. “The law introduced full cost disclosure, prohibited hidden fees, guaranteed fair early-repayment rights, and imposed clear standards for licensing, governance, and risk management.”
He added that these reforms significantly strengthened consumer confidence, enhanced market discipline, and created a stable yet competitive environment that allows companies to grow responsibly while safeguarding customer rights. “This balance between growth and protection is what has enabled the sector to deliver sustainable expansion and consistently high service standards,” he noted.
Zaater also revealed that the Federation is working closely with the FRA and the banking sector to develop a unified credit database for consumer finance. The initiative aims to improve credit assessment processes, support smaller and first-time borrowers, and reinforce overall market stability by reducing information asymmetry.
Strong partnerships with banks
Ahmed Osama, Managing Director of Drive Finance and a member of the Federation’s Board of Directors, highlighted the critical role played by Egyptian banks in supporting the sector’s growth.
“The consumer finance sector today is built on a strong and structured partnership with the banking system,” Osama said. “Banks provide clearly defined credit facilities and financing programs that enable consumer finance companies to meet growing demand in a safe and sustainable manner.”
He explained that this collaboration reflects banks’ confidence in the soundness of consumer finance portfolios and the robustness of the sector’s risk-management practices. At the same time, it underscores the expanding role of consumer finance in supporting the real economy by stimulating demand and strengthening household purchasing power.
Osama added that preparations are underway for the adoption of Basel III–based capital adequacy requirements, describing the move as a strategic milestone for the sector. “Basel III standards are designed to enhance capital resilience and strengthen risk controls,” he said. “The pilot phase is scheduled to begin in January 2026, and companies are already aligning their systems and capital structures in anticipation.”
Technology and supervision strengthen credit quality
Osama Farid, Chief Executive Officer of Premium Card and Board Member of the Federation, said that the sector now operates within a modern, technology-driven ecosystem that has significantly enhanced decision-making and oversight.
“Advanced data analytics, integration across multiple databases, and real-time fraud-monitoring systems have transformed the way consumer finance operates,” Farid said. “These tools have improved the efficiency of credit decisions and strengthened ongoing portfolio monitoring.”
He credited the FRA with playing a central role in this progress by establishing clear supervisory standards and encouraging the use of technology to regulate cash conversion and ensure financing is used strictly for its intended purposes. According to Farid, this regulatory approach has enhanced credit quality, reinforced consumer protection, and increased the sector’s attractiveness to both local and international investors.
Addressing the issue of cash conversion, Farid noted that it has become a key supervisory priority. Financing is now directly linked to approved suppliers and service providers, limiting misuse of funds. In parallel, unified anti-fraud systems and enhanced data sharing allow for early detection of abnormal patterns, preserving the integrity of the activity.
Financing essential needs, not luxuries
Ali Abdel Wahab, Executive Director of Consumer Finance at B.TECH and a Board Member of the Federation, said that market data confirms the responsible behavior of Egyptian consumers.
“Experience shows that consumer finance in Egypt is primarily used to meet essential needs,” Abdel Wahab said. “The bulk of financing goes toward food, healthcare, education, and basic living expenses—areas that directly shape everyday family life.”
He stressed that this usage pattern dispels concerns about excessive or speculative borrowing and confirms the sector’s role in helping households manage obligations while maintaining a reasonable standard of living. Abdel Wahab also highlighted the sector’s contribution to formal financial inclusion, noting that millions of consumers now have an established credit history for the first time.
“This development strengthens consumer protection, supports a more mature financial culture, and expands access to safe, regulated financing,” he said.
Looking ahead to 2026
The EFCF said that 2026 will represent the next phase in the evolution of Egypt’s consumer finance sector. Key priorities include further expansion of digital services, the entry of new fintech-driven players, and the launch of the Basel III pilot phase to reinforce long-term stability.
The Federation also announced plans to roll out new awareness and education initiatives aimed at improving consumer credit literacy, advancing data and analytics capabilities, and enhancing companies’ ability to reach customers in governorates beyond major urban centers.
“With strong regulation, disciplined growth, and a clear strategic vision, consumer finance is well positioned to continue supporting Egyptian households and contributing to sustainable economic development,” the Federation concluded.",1212,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9493180513381958,2025-12-21T09:23:36.555368
2025-12-20,Egypt’s urban inflation eases to 12.3% in November as food price pressures subside: CBE,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/20/egypts-urban-inflation-eases-to-12-3-in-november-as-food-price-pressures-subside-cbe/,"Annual urban headline inflation in Egypt eased slightly to 12.3% in November 2025, down from 12.5% in October, according to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). The moderation was mainly driven by a slowdown in food price inflation, which declined to 0.7% in November from 1.5% a month earlier. Non-food inflation also edged down marginally, registering 20.2% in November compared with 20.4% in October.
Annual core inflation, however, increased to 12.5% in November from 12.1% in October. On a monthly basis, core inflation decelerated sharply to 0.8% from 2.0% in October, although it remained higher than the 0.4% recorded in November 2024. This slowdown was largely attributed to a decline in core food prices, which fell by 0.8% during the month.
Monthly urban headline inflation dropped significantly to 0.3% in November, compared with 1.8% in October and 0.5% in November 2024. The monthly decline reflected broad-based decreases in both volatile and core food prices, which more than offset increases in service, retail, and regulated item prices.
At the national level, annual rural headline inflation remained broadly stable at 7.9% in November, up slightly from 7.8% in October, while nationwide headline inflation held steady at 10.0%, easing marginally from 10.1% in the previous month.
Food prices were the main driver of the monthly decline in inflation. Monthly food inflation contracted by 2.6% in November, contributing negative 1.0 percentage point to headline inflation. This was largely due to a sharp drop in volatile food prices, which declined by 11.7%, driven by a 1.8% decrease in fresh fruit prices and a pronounced 17.8% fall in vegetable prices. These declines were broadly in line with seasonal patterns, though more pronounced than usual. Poultry prices fell by 3.2%, while egg prices declined by 5.7%, reversing the increase recorded in October and further easing food inflation pressures.
In contrast, monthly non-food inflation rose by 2.1% in November, contributing 1.3 percentage points to headline inflation. This increase was primarily driven by higher regulated prices, which rose by 2.3% following the fuel price hike of 11.6% implemented on October 17 and the subsequent 13.7% increase in public inland transportation fares. Additional upward pressures came from a 7.8% rise in LPG prices and a fifth consecutive monthly increase in tobacco prices, which rose by 0.6%.
Prices of services also increased by 2.2% during the month, reflecting higher rents, private inland transportation costs, and increased spending at restaurants and cafés. Retail prices rose by 1.3%, driven by higher prices for clothing and footwear, household cleaning products, and personal care items.
Monthly core inflation stood at 0.8% in November, reflecting the combined impact of these developments. Core food prices contributed negatively to core inflation, while services and retail items continued to exert upward pressure.",453,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.959350883960724,2025-12-21T09:25:00.105469

During the meeting, El-Khatib emphasized Egypt’s commitment to localizing energy-related industries, transferring advanced technologies, and creating new employment opportunities in the sector. He highlighted the country’s strong capabilities and competitive advantages, which position Egypt to become a regional energy hub.
“Egypt aims to enhance the utilization of sustainable energy resources, with a particular focus on solar energy,” El-Khatib said. “We are also committed to attracting investments through investor-friendly policies, and the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade is fully prepared to provide all necessary facilitation and support to prospective partners.”
The Minister noted that Egypt has invested $550bn in recent years to upgrade infrastructure and implement comprehensive economic reforms, including amendments to fiscal, monetary, and trade policies. He added that these measures have significantly improved the country’s economic indicators.
El-Khatib also highlighted the Ministry’s digital transformation initiatives, including the launch of a unified digital platform consolidating all investment and trade procedures. “This platform helps eliminate bureaucracy, enhances the investment climate, and boosts competitiveness in line with the state’s economic objectives,” he said. He further stressed that Egypt’s economic strategy prioritizes a leading role for the private sector, while the state focuses on coordination and facilitation.
Shihab Kuran expressed Power Edison’s strong interest in entering the Egyptian market, including conducting a feasibility study for local manufacturing.

2025-12-21,Remittances from Egyptians abroad hit $33.9bn in 10M of 2025: CBE,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/21/remittances-from-egyptians-abroad-hit-33-9bn-in-10m-of-2025-cbe/,"Remittances from Egyptians working abroad recorded unprecedented inflows during the first 10 months of 2025, reaching approximately $33.9bn, compared with around $23.7bn in the same period of the previous year, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) announced on Sunday.
On a monthly basis, remittances rose by 26.2% year-on-year in October, reaching about $3.7bn, up from nearly $2.9bn in October 2024, according to the CBE.
Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly has repeatedly affirmed the state’s appreciation of the vital national role played by Egyptians abroad, noting that expatriates have demonstrated a strong sense of belonging and patriotism through the continued rise in remittance inflows. He stressed that remittances represent one of Egypt’s most important sources of foreign currency, particularly amid the economic pressures resulting from regional and global crises.
Madbouly attributed this performance to monetary and economic reform measures undertaken by the Central Bank in coordination with the government, including the adoption of a flexible exchange-rate regime and the government’s continued commitment to its broader economic reform programme.
For its part, the Cabinet’s Media Centre said in a report that the record growth in remittances reflects the prudent monetary policy pursued by the CBE. This approach has helped stabilise the exchange rate, strengthen confidence in the economy, and bolster net international reserves, enhancing the state’s capacity to confront external shocks.
The Media Centre also highlighted the long-term upward trajectory of remittances, noting that inflows have more than doubled over the past decade, reaching $36.5bn in fiscal year 2024/2025, compared with $17.1bn in 2015. It added that the International Monetary Fund has confirmed that the recent surge in remittances reflects growing confidence in the economic reforms implemented since March 2024.
Meanwhile, prominent banking expert Mohamed Abdel Aal described remittances from Egyptians abroad as “Egypt’s inexhaustible mine,” noting that they significantly exceed the value of gold holdings within the country’s foreign exchange reserves.
Abdel Aal said that while remittances primarily support Egyptian families, they also constitute a strategic economic lifeline whose value surpasses that of traditional reserve assets. He pointed out that gold holdings in the CBE’s reserves amount to roughly $16.5bn, whereas annual remittance inflows currently exceed $34bn.
He explained that gold is a fixed reserve asset whose value fluctuates with global prices, whereas remittances represent a renewable, recurring flow that is replenished annually. Unlike foreign direct investment or external borrowing, these inflows are generated by Egyptian human capital abroad and do not create future financial obligations.
According to Abdel Aal, remittances are driven by social and economic motivations, making them more resilient and flexible than other sources of foreign currency that are often vulnerable to geopolitical tensions or global market volatility. He added that while gold serves as a reserve asset in times of crisis, it is not readily liquid for daily economic needs. Remittances, by contrast, enter the economy as immediately usable foreign currency, supporting imports, meeting external obligations, and reinforcing reserves.
Abdel Aal noted that remittances declined in 2022/2023 due to the expansion of the parallel currency market. However, following the liberalisation of the exchange rate in March 2024 and subsequent reforms, inflows surged and returned to official channels.
He said that remittances rose by 84.4% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the same period a year earlier, reaching $30.2bn in the first months of the year alone. Drivers of this growth include exchange-rate unification, government incentives such as the duty-free car import initiative, high-yield savings instruments, and social factors such as expatriates’ support for their families and their attachment to Egypt.
To sustain these inflows, Abdel Aal called for deeper integration of expatriates into the domestic economy through dollar-denominated investment funds, entrepreneurship programmes, health insurance and pension schemes, as well as targeted tax and customs incentives.
He concluded that remittances from Egyptians abroad are not merely balance-of-payments figures, but a strategic national asset whose annual value and reliability surpass those of even the most precious metals held in the country’s vaults.",654,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.958747923374176,2025-12-22T09:31:48.332543

Saied Embaby, CEO of iSagha, said local gold prices increased by roughly EGP 45 over the week. The price of 21-karat gold opened trading at EGP 5,745 per gram, touched EGP 5,800, and closed at EGP 5,790. Meanwhile, global gold rose by approximately $40 per ounce, from $4,299 at the start of the week to $4,339 at the close.
Embaby added that 24-karat gold reached EGP 6,617 per gram, 18-karat gold stood at EGP 4,963, and the price of a gold pound climbed to EGP 46,320.
Since the beginning of 2025, local gold prices have surged by around EGP 2,050, marking a 55% increase. Globally, gold has risen by about $1,715 per ounce, or 65%, delivering its strongest annual performance since 1979.
The gains have been driven by sustained central bank purchases, rising inflationary pressures, and expectations of interest rate cuts. Last week, spot gold prices approached record levels, reaching $4,374 per ounce on Thursday, close to this year’s peak of $4,381, despite rising global bond yields.
Economic data suggesting weaker US consumer confidence and slightly lower inflation expectations supported gold’s momentum. The University of Michigan reported that the US consumer sentiment index fell to 52.9 in December from 53.3, below market expectations of 53.5. Respondents anticipated higher unemployment and continued declines in durable goods purchases, while one-year inflation expectations rose to 4.2% and five-year expectations held steady at 3.2%.
Meanwhile, US Treasury yields increased after the Bank of Japan raised its interest rate from 0.50% to 0.75%, pushing the 10-year US Treasury yield up by 2.5 basis points to 4.147%. Despite this typically negative correlation with gold, prices continued to rise, supported by strong demand.
John Williams, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, noted that recent data indicate further moderation in inflation and emphasized that there is currently no urgent need to adjust monetary policy. Markets are pricing in cumulative rate cuts of around 60 basis points by the Fed over 2026, with the first expected in June. Traders also assign a roughly 20% probability of a rate cut at the January 28 meeting.
Goldman Sachs forecasts that gold could rise by 14% to $4,900 per ounce by December 2026, citing potential upside risks if retail investors continue diversifying their portfolios.

Speaking at a meeting of the Council of the Union of Arab Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, Kouchouk said that the government’s tax and customs facilitation initiatives are designed to build trust and foster partnership with the business community, while delivering rapid and tangible results on the ground.
The Minister stressed that the Egyptian and Arab private sector has the capacity to drive a major leap in regional economies, adding that the government’s role is to provide maximum support to unlock this potential.
Kouchouk said Egypt is working to position itself as a regional hub for manufacturing and exports to Africa, Europe and Asia, within the framework of broader economic policies aimed at enhancing competitiveness and attracting foreign direct investment.
He noted that Egypt’s fiscal and economic priorities place greater emphasis on the private sector’s role in investing for the future, in a way that serves both economic growth and citizens’ interests. He added that intra-regional investments have increased significantly, while considerable opportunities remain for deeper trade integration.
The Minister also highlighted improvements in the banking sector’s net foreign assets and growth in foreign exchange reserves, reflecting increased financial stability.
On public finances, Kouchouk said the debt ratio of budgetary entities to GDP declined from 96% to 86% over the past two years, with further reductions targeted this year. He added that Egypt has reduced the external debt of budgetary entities by around $2 billion, underscoring that the country is “repaying more than it is borrowing.”
Kouchouk pointed to strong investment momentum in the economic zones, which have attracted a wide range of companies focused on production and export. He noted that the 73% increase in private investment during the last fiscal year demonstrates the private sector’s ability to lead Egypt’s economic growth.

2025-12-22,Egypt’s digital exports reach $7.4bn over seven years: Communications Minister,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/22/egypts-digital-exports-reach-7-4bn-over-seven-years-communications-minister/,"Egypt’s digital exports reached $7.4bn over the past seven years, marking a 124% increase from $3.3bn in 2018, Minister of Communications and Information Technology Amr Talaat said, noting the sustained expansion of the communications and information technology (ICT) sector.
Speaking at the monthly meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, Talaat said the ICT sector has remained the fastest-growing in the economy over the past seven years, recording annual growth rates of between 14% and 16%. He added that the sector’s contribution to gross domestic product rose from 3.2% to 6% during the current year.
The Minister said outsourcing exports doubled over the past three years, increasing from $2.4bn in 2022 to $4.8bn in 2025. He added that the number of companies operating in Egypt’s outsourcing industry increased from 90 to 240, with more than 270 service delivery centres currently in operation nationwide.
Talaat reviewed the vision and key pillars of Egypt’s Digital Strategy, which is built on four main pillars: fostering digital innovation, enhancing digital services for citizens, driving GDP growth and exports, and creating jobs in the digital economy. These pillars are underpinned by two core foundations—robust digital infrastructure and a supportive legislative environment.
He stressed the Ministry’s commitment to expanding the pool of qualified ICT professionals to support digital transformation projects, noting that workforce development is a major factor in attracting global companies to establish service centres in Egypt. He said the number of trainees in technological specialisations increased 200-fold over seven years, rising from 4,000 in fiscal year 2018/2019 to 500,000 in the last fiscal year, with a target of training 800,000 individuals in the current fiscal year.
Talaat said the digital capacity-building strategy is based on two main tracks—formal education and vocational training—aimed at aligning education and training programmes with labour market needs. He highlighted the graduation of the first cohort from Egypt University of Informatics in the New Administrative Capital, as well as the expansion of WE Schools of Applied Technology from a single school in 2021 to 27 schools across all governorates.
He also noted the diversification of training delivery methods, including in-person training, online learning via digital platforms, and blended learning models. Talaat pointed to the MaharaTech platform, which offers specialised digital training content across a wide range of technological fields.
The Minister said the Ministry focuses on building a comprehensive skills framework for trainees that includes technical, language, and soft skills, as well as freelance and entrepreneurship capabilities. He added that programmes have been launched to prepare young people for the freelance economy and to support non-ICT professionals in developing AI-related skills. He also referred to the Digitopia competition, which aims to identify talent in digital creativity.
Talaat noted that Egypt launched its National Artificial Intelligence Strategy in 2019, contributing to the country’s advancement by 46 places in the Government AI Readiness Index. He added that the second edition of the strategy, launched earlier this year, is built around six pillars: data, skills, ecosystem, infrastructure, applications, and governance. He highlighted ongoing efforts to deploy AI-based systems to improve service delivery, including an early breast cancer detection system and a speech-to-text system used in court sessions.
The Minister also reviewed achievements supporting Egypt’s position as a global outsourcing destination. He said agreements signed in November last year with 55 global and local companies will generate around 75,000 new jobs over the next three years. This follows agreements signed with 29 companies in 2022 to expand or establish outsourcing centres, which initially targeted 34,000 jobs and resulted in 60,000 jobs implemented by the end of 2024.
Talaat said 15 global and local brands are currently manufacturing mobile phones in Egypt, with a local value-added component of around 40%. He added that production capacity increased from 3.3 million units in 2024 to 10 million units in 2025.
He also highlighted progress in digital government services, noting that the Egypt Digital Services Platform now offers 210 government services, serves more than 10 million users, and processes around 2 million transactions each month.
On infrastructure, Talaat said investments of $6bn have been made since 2019 to upgrade fixed and mobile internet networks, including $2.7bn for mobile services and $3.3bn for fixed broadband. This has driven a nearly 16-fold increase in average internet speed to 91.3 Mbps, placing Egypt first globally in average fixed broadband speed, compared with 40th place in 2018.
He added that the second phase of the network development programme includes expanding fibre-optic deployment nationwide, connecting around 4,500 villages under the “Decent Life” initiative, and rolling out 5G, Wi-Fi Calling, Internet of Things services for vehicles, and a telemarketing governance system. He noted that more than 90% of data traffic between Asia and Europe passes through Egypt via 21 international submarine cables, including six currently under construction.
Talaat concluded by highlighting the legislative and regulatory framework governing the sector, including the Cybercrime Law, the Personal Data Protection Law, the Egyptian Responsible AI Charter, the Cloud First Policy, and the Open Data Policy.",830,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9420052766799928,2025-12-23T09:30:15.154383

During the discussions, Rahmy reviewed the participants’ projects and listened to the main challenges they encounter, particularly those related to marketing, patent activation, expansion into global markets, export opportunities, supply chain development, networking with government institutions supporting entrepreneurship, access to financing mechanisms, and the establishment of small-scale factories as an alternative to fragmented outsourcing arrangements.
He stressed that MSMEDA’s doors remain open to all citizens and young innovators, in line with the directives of Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, Chairperson of MSMEDA’s Board of Directors, which place the support of innovative entrepreneurship among the Agency’s top priorities.

Penalties for commercial transport violations have also been increased, combining higher fines with potential jail sentences.

2025-12-24,Strong expectations of interest-rate cut at CBE’s year-end meeting,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/24/strong-expectations-of-interest-rate-cut-at-cbes-year-end-meeting/,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) is set to hold its final meeting of 2025 on Thursday, amid strong market expectations that it will cut key policy interest rates.
The MPC will decide on the fate of the CBE’s benchmark rates, which guide short-term interest-rate movements on the Egyptian pound. At its previous meeting on 20 November, the Committee opted to keep rates unchanged at 21% for deposits, 22% for lending, and 21.5% for both the credit and discount rate and the main operation rate. This decision followed cumulative cuts of around 6.25% earlier in the year, implemented in four stages: 2.25% in April, 1% in May, 2% in August, and 1% in October.
Inflation developments
Explaining its November decision, the MPC said it was based on its assessment of inflation developments and the outlook since the previous meeting in October.
The Committee noted that inflation expectations remain exposed to upside risks, both globally and domestically. These include the potential escalation of geopolitical tensions, the relative persistence of services inflation, and fiscal consolidation measures exceeding expectations. It stressed that such risks require close monitoring of inflation trends and their implications over the forecast horizon, warranting a cautious approach to monetary easing.
The MPC added that it had adopted a wait-and-see approach by keeping policy rates unchanged, considering this stance appropriate for containing inflationary pressures, anchoring expectations, and reinforcing the downward trajectory of inflation.
The Committee reiterated that monetary policy decisions will continue to be assessed on a meeting-by-meeting basis, depending on the evolving outlook, associated risks, and incoming data. It reaffirmed its commitment to achieving price stability by steering inflation towards its target of 7% (± 2%) on average in the fourth quarter of 2026, stressing that it would not hesitate to use all available tools to meet this objective.
Earlier this month, the CBE reported that core inflation rose to 12.5% in November 2025, up from 12.1% in October, while the monthly core consumer price index increased by 0.8%, compared with 2% a month earlier.
Meanwhile, the monthly change in the headline consumer price index for urban areas, as reported by the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics, stood at 0.3% in November, down from 1.8% in October. Annual headline inflation in urban areas eased to 12.3% from 12.5%.
Expectations of investment banks and experts
A number of investment banks–including EFG Hermes, Al-Naeem, Al-Ahly Pharos, Mubasher Financial, Cairo Capital, Arabia Online and Thndr–have forecast an interest-rate cut of between 50 and 100 basis points at Thursday’s meeting.
A Reuters poll of 14 economists also showed expectations that the CBE would cut its key policy rates by 100 basis points, citing the slight slowdown in inflation in November.
Prominent banking expert Mohamed Abdel Aal expects the MPC to prioritise economic growth and resume the easing cycle by cutting interest rates by between 100 and 200 basis points at its final meeting of the year.
Abdel Aal said several factors underpin this view, foremost among them the CBE’s target of bringing average inflation down to 7% (± 2%) by the end of 2026. Achieving this, he argued, would require the nominal policy rate to fall to around 13-15%. With the current average policy rate standing at about 21.25%, the MPC would need to cut rates by 600-800 basis points over the medium term, justifying a faster pace of easing starting from the upcoming meeting.
He added that the US Federal Reserve’s ongoing rate cuts help preserve an attractive interest-rate differential between the Egyptian pound and the US dollar, even if Egypt eases policy. This, he said, gives the CBE sufficient room to lower rates and stimulate growth without risking a sharp decline in foreign portfolio inflows.
Mohamed Abdel Aal
Real interest rate
According to Abdel Aal, Egypt’s real interest rate remains high at around 8.75%, a contractionary level that constrains growth. Reducing rates would help lower borrowing costs for businesses and households, encourage investment and spending, and support economic expansion at a time of relative inflation stability.
He also highlighted the fiscal impact, noting that every 1% cut in interest rates reduces government debt-servicing costs by around EGP 70bn, easing pressure on the state budget.
Abdel Aal further pointed to the relative stability–and recent strength–of the Egyptian pound against the US dollar, which lowers the cost of imported inputs and finished goods. This “imported inflation mitigation”, he said, gives producers room to absorb cost increases rather than passing them fully on to consumers.
He added that while rate cuts do not yield immediate effects, they gradually reduce financing costs, allowing companies either to cut prices to enhance competitiveness or absorb higher energy costs, thereby supporting growth through lower credit burdens.
Taken together, Abdel Aal concluded, the objectives of supporting growth, avoiding economic stagnation, and easing the public debt burden tilt the balance in favour of a 200-basis-point rate cut at Thursday’s MPC meeting.
Egypt’s external position
Meanwhile, HC Securities and Investment expects the CBE to cut interest rates by 150 basis points.
Heba Mounir, the firm’s macroeconomic analyst, said Egypt’s external position has shown resilience, with net international reserves rising by 0.29% month-on-month and by around 7% since the start of the year to a record $50.2bn in November.
She noted that net foreign assets in the banking sector increased by around 9% month-on-month to $22.7bn in October, while remittances from Egyptians abroad rose by 26% year-on-year to $3.7bn. In addition, Egypt’s one-year credit default swap spread fell sharply to 138 basis points, and Suez Canal revenues increased by about 17% year-on-year during the first five months of the current fiscal year.
“These factors contributed to a roughly 7% appreciation of the Egyptian pound against the dollar since the beginning of the year,” Mounir said.
On the domestic front, she added, the Purchasing Managers’ Index reached 51.1 points in November–its highest level since October 2020–supported by stronger demand and easing cost pressures.
HC expects inflation to continue its gradual decline due to base effects and believes current Treasury bill yields remain attractive for foreign investors, offering a real return of about 10.5% after tax, based on a forecast of 11% average inflation over the next 12 months.
The firm added that the decline in Egypt’s CDS spread is likely to contribute to further reductions in the yields demanded by investors.
“Based on improvements in Egypt’s external position, the exchange rate, and easing inflation, we expect the MPC to cut interest rates by 150 basis points at its 25 December meeting to stimulate private-sector growth,” HC said.
Heba Mounir
Egyptian monetary policy management
Banking expert Shaimaa Wagih also expects an interest-rate cut at the CBE’s final meeting of 2025, describing the decision as a strategic turning point in Egypt’s monetary policy management.
She said the move would reflect a balanced approach that supports economic activity while safeguarding financial-market stability, noting improvements in inflation indicators and liquidity conditions.
“A rate cut reflects a clear and well-calibrated economic vision,” Wagih said, citing lower borrowing costs, stronger investment, enhanced purchasing power, improved liquidity, and stronger aggregate demand as key benefits.
Shaimaa Wagih
She added that such a decision would positively affect the banking sector and capital markets by lowering financing costs, encouraging productive investment, and supporting banks’ ability to diversify loan portfolios and improve returns.
According to Wagih, the expected move underscores the CBE’s precise and balanced monetary management, taking into account inflation control, exchange-rate stability and liquidity conditions in a way that strengthens the resilience of the financial system.
She concluded that a rate cut at Thursday’s meeting would represent a carefully calculated step aimed at stimulating growth and domestic investment while preserving monetary and financial stability, reinforcing confidence in Egypt’s economic management.",1286,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.514254629611969,2025-12-25T09:27:33.509909

The total reflects a 54.6% growth in financing granted between January and October 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Since Mohamed Farid assumed the chairmanship of the FRA in August 2022, financing activities have grown by 82.5%, rising from EGP 584bn at the end of 2022 to the current EGP 1.1trn.
The FRA’s data provided a breakdown of the financing distributed during the ten-month period:
Equity issuances:
EGP 553.4bn, representing growth of 41.6%.
Financial leasing contracts:
EGP 139.9bn, with a growth rate of 58.2%.
Factoring activity:
EGP 102bn, an 82.4% increase.
SME and micro-enterprise financing:
EGP 85.9bn, up 11.9%.
Securities issuances (excluding shares):
EGP 77.2bn, a 145.8% increase.
Consumer finance:
EGP 74.9bn, rising by 58%.
Mortgage finance:
EGP 32.5bn, a 55.5% growth.
Movable collateral also saw significant growth during the January–October 2025 period, with the value of registered assets in the registry reaching EGP 4trn, a 39.8% increase year-on-year. Furthermore, financing balances for small, medium, and micro-enterprises (SMEs) rose to EGP 93.8bn by the end of October 2025, a 27.1% increase compared to the same period in 2024. The FRA stated these indicators reflect the resilience and sustainability of non-banking financial growth, and the role of the regulatory and legislative framework in supporting credit flow, financial inclusion, and economic activity.
In a separate development, the FRA completed an update of its Responsible Pricing Reference Index for SME and micro-project financing products, based on September 2025 prices. The index, launched by Farid in September 2023, is the first of its kind in Egypt’s financial sector.
The latest statistical data for the index revealed that non-bank financing costs in Egypt remained relatively stable between September 2024 and September 2025, with limited price movements across most financing categories despite current economic variables. The update is intended to allow consumers to compare costs and support rational financing decisions through increased transparency.
“The periodic review of the Responsible Pricing Index for micro, small, and medium enterprise products showed important results in September 2025,” Farid said. He added that the data reflected the flexibility of licensed entities in managing costs and their ability to absorb market changes while directing financing toward low- and medium-risk customers.
According to the index, individual micro-project financing prices moved within stable ranges during September 2025. Median pricing levels (Median) ranged from approximately 30% for low-risk customers to 32% for high-risk customers. Minimum pricing levels remained stable across all risk categories, while market trends showed a concentration of financing entities dealing with medium-risk clients.
Group micro-project financing also showed price stability, with median rates ranging between 31.5% for low-risk customers and 33% for high-risk customers. For SME projects, the index showed a positive stability compared to other products, with the median price range limited to between 22.4% and 22.7% across various risk categories. Minimum pricing (Minimum) for SMEs remained between 19.5% and 20.6%.
The FRA reported that 81% of SME financing entities adhered to the responsible pricing standards according to the index. Meanwhile, commitment rates stood at 64.4% for individual financing entities and 64.3% for group financing entities.",543,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8889300227165222,2025-12-25T09:27:43.336095

Khaled Abdel Ghaffar, Deputy Prime Minister for Human Development and Minister of Health and Population, provided an overview of Giza’s health landscape, noting that the governorate serves 9,564,743 people.
According to Abdel Ghaffar, Giza contains 190 hospitals—31 government and 159 private—alongside 239 primary care facilities, which include 22 health departments, 196 health offices, and 212 health units. He detailed the capacity of the sector, stating that the government provides 2,735 inpatient beds and 537 intensive care beds, while the private sector contributes 4,957 inpatient and 1,343 intensive care beds.
In terms of medical equipment, the government sector operates 729 dialysis machines and 357 incubators, compared to 289 machines and 659 incubators in private facilities. Additionally, 654 ventilators are available in the government sector and 678 in the private sector. The health minister noted that the ministry’s facilities employ 4,050 doctors, 2,851 dentists, 4,314 pharmacists, and 6,657 nurses, while private hospitals employ 6,109 doctors, 211 dentists, 507 pharmacists, and 5,994 nurses.

Polyester and Polymer Complex
Tyre Manufacturing Facility
Health Products and Nonwoven Fabrics
The total investment attracted in the last six months has already surpassed the $4.6bn recorded during the entire FY2024/25, SCZONE Chairperson Walid Gamal El-Dien said on Tuesday. The new agreements, signed at the government headquarters in the New Capital, are expected to create 5,400 direct jobs.
Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, who witnessed the signing, said the projects reflect “growing confidence from major international companies in Egypt’s investment climate.” He added that the SCZONE’s infrastructure and logistical integration between industrial areas and ports support the state’s strategy to deepen local manufacturing, increase exports, and provide employment.
The contracts were signed between Teda-Egypt and three Chinese firms for projects within the Sokhna Industrial Zone.
Polyester and Polymer Complex
The largest of the three agreements involves the Xin Feng Ming Group, which will establish an integrated industrial complex for polyester fibres and polymers with investments exceeding $800m.
Spanning 400,000 square metres, the project will be implemented in three phases with a total annual production capacity of 1.08 million tonnes, creating 3,000 jobs.
Phase one of the project, including the construction, is scheduled to begin in May 2026, with operations starting in the fourth quarter of 2027.
While phase two is set to begin in 2028 and become operational in 2029, phase three implementation starts in 2029 with operations commencing in 2030.
The first two phases include production lines for POY and DTY polyester yarn with an annual capacity exceeding 360,000 tonnes and expected annual sales of $455m. The third phase aims to complete industrial integration to bridge the gap in raw materials for the Egyptian textile industry, particularly in upstream manufacturing, while directing 50% of production toward regional and international export markets.
Tyre Manufacturing Facility
A second contract was signed with Chaoyang Langma Tyre to build a complex for heavy truck and passenger car tyres. The project involves an expected investment of $190m on a 200,000 square metre site, providing 1,400 jobs.
The project will be executed in two main stages, the first starting in April 2026, focusing on basic construction and a heavy truck tyre (TBR) production line.
The second phase, starting in September 2028 for 12 months, will include expansions to the TBR line and the establishment of a passenger car tyre (PCR) line.
Targeted annual capacities are 1 million heavy truck tyres and 4.5 million passenger car tyres.
Health Products and Nonwoven Fabrics
The third agreement with Tongling Jieya Biotechnology involves a $160m industrial complex for health products. Located on 160,000 square metres, the facility will create 1,000 jobs.
The company aims for an annual production capacity of 10 billion wet wipes, 2 billion baby diapers, and 100,000 tonnes of nonwoven fabrics using water-jet and hot-air technologies. The project is expected to generate $270m in annual revenue at full operation.
Gamal El-Dien stated that these investments represent the targeted industrial diversity for the SCZONE, spanning textile inputs, heavy industries, and advanced health products. He noted that the surge in investment to $5.1bn in record time demonstrates the success of the partnership with Teda-Egypt and the zone’s readiness to host large-scale projects.",557,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8174411654472351,2025-12-25T09:28:14.828144
2025-12-27,1% interest-rate cut appropriate to sustain disinflation path: CBE,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/27/1-interest-rate-cut-appropriate-to-sustain-disinflation-path-cbe/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) said a 1% cut in interest rates is appropriate to maintain a monetary policy stance that anchors inflation expectations and supports the continued downward trajectory of inflation.
On Thursday evening, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the Bank’s key policy rates—which serve as the main benchmark for short-term interest-rate movements on the Egyptian pound—by 1%, bringing them to 20% for overnight deposits, 21% for overnight lending, and 20.5% for both the main operation rate and the credit and discount rate.
The MPC said the decision reflects its assessment of inflation developments and the inflation outlook since its previous meeting on 20 November.
At the global level, the Committee noted that economic growth has continued its relative recovery, although the outlook remains clouded by uncertainty surrounding trade policies, ongoing geopolitical tensions and slower growth in global demand.
Inflation dynamics globally have remained broadly stable, with central banks in both advanced and emerging economies continuing to adopt a cautious approach to monetary easing through gradual policy adjustments.
In global commodity markets, oil prices declined as global supply outpaced demand, while agricultural commodity prices recorded mixed movements. Nevertheless, the Committee warned that risks remain elevated, particularly given the potential for supply-chain disruptions and escalating geopolitical tensions.
Domestically, the MPC said the CBE’s estimates point to real GDP growth of around 5% in the fourth quarter of 2025, compared with 5.3% in the third quarter. Growth in Q3 was mainly driven by positive contributions from non-oil manufacturing, trade and communications sectors.
Despite the continuation of economic growth, the Committee said the current output path is expected to support the anticipated short-term decline in inflation, as demand-side inflationary pressures are likely to remain contained under the prevailing monetary policy stance.
On inflation developments, the MPC noted that annual headline inflation resumed its downward trend, reaching 12.3% in November 2025, despite the recent increase in fuel prices.
This decline was largely driven by a sharp fall in annual food inflation, which dropped to 0.7%, its lowest level in more than four years. Annual core inflation, meanwhile, stood at 12.5%, reflecting higher prices of non-food items, particularly services.
On a monthly basis, headline and core inflation recorded 0.3% and 0.8%, respectively, in November. The moderation in recent monthly inflation readings compared with typical seasonal patterns indicates an improvement in inflation expectations and the gradual fading of the effects of previous shocks, the Committee said.
Looking ahead, the CBE’s forecasts indicate that annual headline inflation will stabilise near its current levels in the fourth quarter of 2025, averaging around 14% for the year as a whole, compared with 28.3% in 2024.
In 2026, inflation is expected to decline further and approach the Bank’s target by the fourth quarter of the year. However, the pace of disinflation remains constrained by the slow easing of non-food inflation and the impact of fiscal consolidation measures, while global geopolitical tensions continue to pose upside risks to inflation expectations.
The MPC reaffirmed that it will continue to assess its decisions regarding the pace of monetary easing based on the inflation outlook, surrounding risks and incoming data. It said it will closely monitor economic and financial developments and will not hesitate to use all available tools to achieve price stability by steering inflation towards its target of 7% (±2%) on average in the fourth quarter of 2026.",561,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.8220447897911072,2025-12-28T09:23:43.004468

The portfolio represents a 2.8% share of total mortgage financing directed to low- and middle-income housing, serving 33,890 beneficiaries nationwide.
Data issued by the Fund highlight United Bank’s growing role in supporting the real estate sector and expanding access to affordable housing for low- and middle-income citizens across Egypt.
Tarek Fayad, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of United Bank, said that expanding mortgage finance for low- and middle-income housing is one of the State’s and the Central Bank of Egypt’s key mechanisms for achieving social justice, eliminating informal settlements, enhancing financial inclusion and empowering vulnerable groups.
He explained that this is achieved by stimulating the housing market to provide subsidised units across governorates—particularly in Upper Egypt and new urban communities—contributing to higher economic growth and the achievement of sustainable development.
Fayad added that mortgage finance solutions represent a core focus of the Bank’s strategy. United Bank currently operates across 16 governorates and 12 new cities nationwide, continuously enhancing service quality in terms of speed and efficiency through the adoption of digital transformation tools.
The Bank delivers mortgage finance services through 68 branches across the country and, in recent years, has launched a range of advanced, digitally supported financing solutions to improve customer experience and accelerate access to finance. These include digital wallets, mobile banking and internet banking services, which facilitate transactions, save time and effort, and help clients meet their payment obligations on schedule.
United Bank provides mortgage finance services in nine Upper Egypt governorates—Giza, Fayoum, Beni Suef, Minya, Assiut, Sohag, Qena, Luxor and Aswan—as well as four governorates in the Canal region: Port Said, Suez, Ismailia and the Red Sea.
In addition, the Bank operates in 12 new urban communities, including 6th of October City, 10th of Ramadan City, Obour, Shorouk, Badr, Borg El Arab, Nubaria, New Damietta, New Alamein City, Sheikh Zayed, Sadat City and 15 May City. It also covers seven governorates in Delta: Monufeya, Gharbia, Beheira, Kafr El-Sheikh, Sharqeya, Dakahleya and Cairo.

2025-12-27,EGP 25bn project launched to supply electricity to one million feddans in West Minya Plain,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/27/egp-25bn-project-launched-to-supply-electricity-to-one-million-feddans-in-west-minya-plain/,"The Egyptian Countryside Development Company has announced the launch of a major project to construct extra-high-voltage and high-voltage power stations and feeder lines, in coordination with the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company, an affiliate of the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy.
The move represents a new step in supporting efforts to develop and reclaim lands under the national 1.5 Million Feddan Project, contributing to sustainable development across its various sites and regions.
According to a company statement, a cooperation and consultancy contract has been signed with one of the largest specialised firms in the field of extra-high-voltage substations—the Egyptian Power Systems Engineering Company (EPS). Under the agreement, EPS will review technical designs and supervise tendering and implementation works for supplying electricity to the Egyptian Countryside Development Company’s lands in the West Minya Plain.
The electricity extension project targets approximately one million feddans of land in the West Minya Plain, at an estimated total cost of EGP 25bn. The project will be implemented in two phases. The first phase, with a capacity of 100 megavolt-amperes (MVA), will cover the areas of South-West West Minya, the western extension of Minya, and West Manfalut and Al-Qusiya. The second phase will extend to Darb Al-Behnasawy, West Minya, and North-West West Minya.
Upon completion of all phases, the project’s total capacity is expected to reach around 500 MVA, enabling electricity supply across the entire scope of the 1.5 Million Feddan Project lands in the West Minya Plain.
Amr Abdel Wahab, Chairperson and Managing Director of the Egyptian Countryside Development Company, said the cooperation represents a significant milestone in agricultural development efforts within the national project. He stressed that the provision of electricity goes beyond basic infrastructure preparation, describing it as a pivotal element in enabling modern agriculture, supporting investors and creating an integrated environment for agricultural and food production.
“We are implementing this project in cooperation with the consultancy entity and the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy, within the framework of a national partnership aimed at accelerating development and achieving food security by supporting farmers and equipping land with the necessary infrastructure,” Abdel Wahab said.
He noted that extending electricity to the West Minya Plain is part of a comprehensive infrastructure strategy that also includes road development, the establishment of communications networks and future plans for renewable energy stations.
“This project will directly improve agricultural production efficiency, encourage investors to inject capital into fully serviced lands, and create job opportunities for young people in Upper Egypt,” he added. “It also supports a more balanced distribution of development, in line with Egypt Vision 2030.”
Abdel Wahab emphasised that all phases of the project are being implemented in accordance with the highest international technical standards, under the supervision of the consultancy firm. He added that coordination between public and private entities ensures optimal results within the planned timelines and reflects a successful model of cooperation in delivering major national projects.
“What is being implemented today in the West Minya Plain represents a practical translation of Egypt Vision 2030 and a model of integrated development in a promising region,” he said, noting that the project will help generate hundreds of job opportunities, stimulate agricultural investment and establish a stable and sustainable productive community.",536,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8469271659851074,2025-12-28T09:24:37.023748
2025-12-27,"CBE’s 1% rate cut eases financing costs, boosts industry, market confidence",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/27/cbes-1-rate-cut-eases-financing-costs-boosts-industry-market-confidence/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) announced a 1% cut in its key interest rates last Thursday, marking a significant step towards easing monetary conditions and supporting economic activity amid signs of moderating inflation.
The decision was widely welcomed by lawmakers, business leaders and industry experts, who described it as a timely move to stimulate production, investment and competitiveness across key sectors of the economy.
Support for Industry and Production
Ahmed Ismail Sabra, Member of Parliament and Chairperson of the Investors Association in the Gamasa Industrial Zone, said the interest-rate cut provides direct support to the industrial sector at a critical juncture. He noted that lower borrowing costs will help manufacturers expand and modernise operations, enhance the competitiveness of Egyptian products in local, regional and international markets, and create additional job opportunities, particularly for young people.
Sabra stressed the importance of coordination between monetary and fiscal policies to achieve comprehensive economic and social development, adding that industrial zones—especially Gamasa—are well positioned to benefit from the improved financing environment.
Mohamed Adel Hosny, a member of the Industry Committee at the Egyptian Businessmen’s Association and the Federation of Egyptian Industries, said the decision reflects a clear state vision to support economic growth and reinforce industry as a primary engine of the national economy.
He explained that lower financing costs enable companies to upgrade production lines, expand capacity and increase exports, while strengthening the competitiveness of Egyptian products. Hosny also highlighted the government’s focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as a key driver of job creation and balanced development across governorates.
Relief for the Private Sector
Amr Fotouh, Chairperson of the Entrepreneurship and SMEs Committee at the Egyptian-Lebanese Business Association, described the rate cut as a major relief for the private sector, encouraging both the expansion of existing projects and the launch of new investments.
He said reduced borrowing and operating costs would support market stability and stimulate trade, production and exports. Fotouh noted that Egypt’s merchandise exports reached around $45bn in 2024 and are expected to exceed $50bn by the end of 2025, adding that easing financing burdens would further strengthen industry as a key source of foreign currency.
Ahmed El-Zayat, a member of the Egyptian Businessmen’s Association, said the return to an interest-rate cutting cycle aligns with the gradual decline in inflation and the CBE’s target of steering inflation towards 7% by the fourth quarter of 2026.
He described the move as a positive signal of economic recovery, encouraging investment over savings, lowering borrowing costs, and supporting job creation, exports and foreign investment inflows.
Impact on the Real Estate Sector
Urban planning expert Mohamed Mostafa El-Qady said cumulative interest-rate cuts exceeding 7% during 2025 have had mixed but largely positive effects on the market, particularly by providing indirect stimulus to the real estate sector.
He explained that extended payment plans offered by developers effectively represent an indirect price reduction, while the maturity of high-yield savings certificates could redirect savings towards property investments in 2026, potentially driving higher demand and prices in the second half of the year.
Abeer Essam El-Din, Chairwoman of the Arab Council for Businesswomen and a board member of the Egyptian Federation of Investor Associations, said monetary easing policies clearly support real estate development, especially for small developers. She added that declining returns on savings certificates enhance the appeal of real estate as a store of value, with expectations of stronger sales and sector growth in 2026.
Positive Tax and Trade Implications
Ramy Fathallah, Chairperson of the Tax and Finance Committee at the Egyptian-Lebanese Business Association, said the interest-rate cut reflects improving macroeconomic indicators and sends a strong signal of confidence in Egypt’s ability to balance inflation control with economic growth.
He noted that lower financing costs would ease pressure on industrial and agricultural companies, stimulate economic activity and indirectly contribute to higher and more sustainable tax revenues, while reinforcing investor confidence.
Despite welcoming the decision, Mohamed Saada, Secretary-General of the Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce and Chair of the Port Said Chamber, said interest rates remain relatively high and require further reductions to achieve a full financing breakthrough.
Saada added that the impact of the cut is expected to become more evident over the next two months, with relative price stability or slight declines, improved purchasing power and stronger economic momentum. He noted that the automotive, real estate and food industries are among the sectors likely to benefit most, alongside increased investment inflows into the local market.",742,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.3815918266773224,2025-12-28T09:24:39.829707

Speaking at a salon hosted by the Institute of National Planning, Kouchouk stated that the external debt of budget agencies has decreased by approximately $4bn during the same two-year period. He added that the state is prioritising debt reduction and is currently paying more than it borrows to improve economic indicators.
The minister detailed the impact of the government’s first package of tax facilities, noting it has encouraged voluntary compliance. According to Kouchouk, taxpayers submitted 612,000 new and amended tax returns and voluntarily disclosed additional economic activity worth EGP 1trn, resulting in EGP 78bn in additional tax payments.
Furthermore, 400,000 requests to close old tax files were received, and 127,000 taxpayers have utilised the integrated simplified tax system to date.
Kouchouk said the strategic goal is to expand the economic, productive, and tax base to benefit citizens and investors. He noted that tax revenues increased by 36% during the last year without imposing new burdens on the business community.
“The private sector is capable of transforming Egypt into a regional centre for production and exports,” Kouchouk said, noting that private investment rose by 73% last year. He highlighted strong growth in the industrial, information technology, and tourism sectors during the previous fiscal year.
The minister announced that a second package of tax incentives for committed taxpayers is being prepared, with additional packages for customs and real estate taxes expected soon to simplify procedures. He added that the new budget will feature increased allocations for health, education, and cash support programmes targeted at the most vulnerable groups.
Kouchouk stated that reducing debt service costs would provide additional resources to improve living standards and allow for higher spending on social protection and economic support. He also noted an “ambitious vision” to develop the resources of local administrations to ensure the benefits of growth reach citizens across all governorates.
Ashraf El-Araby, head of the Institute of National Planning, said the business and economic community welcomed the current path of incentives and facilitation. He emphasised the need to accelerate progress toward the Egypt Vision 2030 targets and reduce economic gaps in the coming years.",396,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.5145149827003479,2025-12-28T09:25:58.168921
2025-12-27,From shield to showcase: Egypt’s military envoys briefed on 2026 economic ‘turning point’,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/27/from-shield-to-showcase-egypts-military-envoys-briefed-on-2026-economic-turning-point/,"In a room filled with the nation’s newly designated military attachés, the talk was not of ballistics or borders, but of textiles, tech hubs, and the price of global trade. Dr. Rania Al-Mashat, Egypt’s Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation, stood before the officers with a directive that extended beyond traditional diplomacy: to represent an economy that she claims has finally pivoted from “managing challenges” to a narrative of “construction and production.”
Contents
The Private Sector Pivot
Governance and the ‘Billion-Pound Ceiling’
The Human and Green Capital
Diplomacy of the Balance Sheet
The setting was symbolic. Addressing the officers as the “shield of the nation,” Al-Mashat sought to arm Egypt’s overseas representatives with a balance sheet to match their uniform. Her message was clear: the Egypt they will represent in 2026 is intended to be a far cry from the debt-burdened state of recent years, aiming instead to be a hub for private-sector-led industry and green energy.
By the third quarter of 2025, the “kernel” of this shift has become evident. Following a series of rigorous fiscal and monetary reforms initiated in March 2024, the Egyptian government is projecting 2026 as a definitive turning point. With growth expected to exceed 5% this fiscal year and an ambitious 7% target on the horizon, the administration is betting that a strict EGP 1 trillion (bn) ceiling on public investment will finally give the private sector the “breathing room” it needs to drive the national engine.
The Private Sector Pivot
Central to Al-Mashat’s briefing was the assertion that Egypt’s growth is no longer a state-funded monolith. Currently, the productive sectors—industry, tourism, and Information and Communications Technology (ICT)—are largely under private stewardship. “The economy is driven by productive, private-sector-led sectors,” Al-Mashat noted, pointing out that 98% of the tourism and industrial sectors are now privately held.
This transition is being felt on the ground. Industrial growth has begun to feed into a surge in exports, while the tourism sector is on track to welcome nearly 19 million visitors this year. Even the Suez Canal, which handles roughly 12% of global trade and remains a vital pulse-point for the economy, is showing signs of recovery. Despite the canal being hit hard by regional volatility, Al-Mashat cited ongoing peace efforts—sponsored by President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and U.S. President Donald Trump—as a catalyst for the waterway’s recent performance gains.
Governance and the ‘Billion-Pound Ceiling’
To ensure this recovery is sustainable, the Ministry has enforced a hard cap on public spending. By limiting public investment to EGP 1 trillion in the 2024/2025 fiscal year, the government has intentionally redirected bank credit toward private enterprises, particularly in the industrial sector.
This fiscal discipline is part of a broader “National Structural Reform Programme” overseen by the Ministry. The scale is vast, involving:
40 national entities
working in coordination.
430 specific measures
covering tax reform, trade, and labor markets.
Unified performance indicators
across all ministries to ensure “horizontal objectives” are met.
“Macroeconomic stability and reform are mutually reinforcing paths,” Al-Mashat told the attachés. “Reforms enhance stability, and stability enables reform.”
The Human and Green Capital
While the figures focus on finance, the strategy increasingly emphasizes the “human pillar.” For the 2025/2026 plan, 48% of public investments are earmarked for human development sectors. The Ministry maintains that a productive future is impossible without a healthy, skilled workforce at the “centre of development.”
Simultaneously, Egypt is repositioning itself as a renewable energy player to mitigate the high costs of fuel imports. Through the “NWFE” (Nexus of Water, Food and Energy) platform, the state has already mobilised approximately USD 5bn in concessional financing for green projects. The ultimate goal is ambitious: a power grid that derives 42% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030.
Diplomacy of the Balance Sheet
As these military attachés prepare for their postings, they carry with them more than 65 new cooperation protocols signed in 2025 alone. Egypt’s strategy now relies on “concessional financing”—lower-cost alternatives to market borrowing—which has secured USD 9.5bn for budget support and USD 17bn for the private sector since 2020.
The completion of the IMF’s fifth and sixth reviews acts as a final seal of approval for this roadmap. As the session concluded, Al-Mashat’s “kicker” for the officers was a reminder of their role in this economic architecture. By representing a stable, reforming Egypt, they are not just envoys of the military, but ambassadors of a 2026 turning point that seeks to translate high-level macro-stability into “tangible benefits for citizens” on the street.",750,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.7304427623748779,2025-12-28T09:26:28.463045

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the CBE decided to reduce the Bank’s key policy rates—which serve as the main benchmark for short-term interest-rate movements on the Egyptian pound—to 20% for overnight deposits, 21% for overnight lending, and 20.5% for both the main operation rate and the credit and discount rate.
In the first direct response to the decision, interest rates on variable-rate savings certificates and certain loan products linked to the CBE’s interest-rate corridor automatically declined by the same percentage as the cut approved by the central bank.
The Egyptian banking market offers a wide range of variable-rate savings certificates, most notably the National Bank of Egypt’s “Platinum” certificate and Banque Misr’s “Al-Qemma” certificate, in addition to a large number of loan products priced off the CBE’s key policy rates.
Meanwhile, market participants are closely monitoring the implications of the rate cut for returns on local debt instruments scheduled to be offered by the government this week, as well as the potential impact on foreign investors’ appetite for Egyptian treasury securities.
On Sunday, the Ministry of Finance is set to offer two Treasury bill auctions worth a combined EGP 60bn: EGP 20bn in 91-day bills and EGP 40bn in 273-day bills. On Monday, the ministry will offer two Treasury bond auctions worth EGP 37bn—EGP 14bn in two-year bonds and EGP 23bn in three-year bonds—alongside an auction of fixed-return sovereign sukuk worth EGP 5bn with a three-year maturity.",282,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.6511706113815308,2025-12-28T09:26:51.619079
2025-12-27,How Should Depositors Invest Their Money After Bank Certificates Mature?,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/27/how-should-depositors-invest-their-money-after-bank-certificates-mature/,"Successful investment is what allows you to sleep peacefully, knowing your money is safe, while real returns are what you actually feel in your pocket when buying your daily needs.
As 2026 approaches, many people are asking how they can preserve the value of their savings after the expiry of high-interest bank certificates.
Before searching for the highest interest rate, it is important to understand the concept of real return. There is little sense in earning 30% interest while prices are rising by 35%, as this means a real loss of 5%. It is far wiser to earn 17% while prices rise by only 12%, resulting in a real gain of 5%. In this case, the actual value of your money increases and your purchasing power improves.
Below is a ranking of investment options for savings, from the safest and most stable to the highest growth and risk:
Bank savings instruments:
Bank certificates remain the safest choice and the cornerstone of household savings. They provide a stable monthly income that helps cover living expenses, while guaranteeing full repayment of the principal at maturity with no risk.
Treasury bills:
Treasury bills rank second in terms of safety and are backed by the Ministry of Finance. They stand out for their flexibility and short maturities, with returns credited in full to your account upon purchase. They can be easily accessed through any branch of Egyptian banks.
Investment funds:
A smart option for those who do not wish to lock in their money for long periods and prefer returns that accumulate daily. These funds allow deposits and withdrawals at any time and are managed by financial professionals to reduce risk.
Stock market and equities:
Suitable for those with surplus funds they will not need in the near term. Buying shares in strong companies offers annual dividends and capital gains, but requires the ability to withstand market volatility.
Metals:
Metals are a store of value and come at the end of the list because they do not generate monthly income and are influenced by global prices. Gold remains the historic guardian of savings against inflation, while silver represents a strong buying opportunity with very promising growth expectations.
Beware of the “dollarisation” trap. Currency speculation is currently the biggest enemy of savings, as it effectively freezes money. Dollars kept at home are “dead money” that generate no return and may also expose holders to legal risks.
In conclusion: how should you allocate your savings?
A smart saver never puts all their eggs in one basket. Keep a core portion in bank certificates for monthly income, a flexible portion in Treasury bills for upfront returns and liquidity, and a future-focused portion in gold or silver to preserve value.
Always remember: successful investment is what allows you to sleep peacefully, knowing your money is safe, and real returns are what you actually feel in your pocket when buying your everyday needs.

The meeting was held within the framework of the state’s strategy to support and develop the tourism sector as a key driver of economic growth, expand hotel capacity, and strengthen partnerships with the private sector.
Discussions focused on prospects for continued cooperation and the progress of major hotel development projects that add significant value to Egypt’s tourism sector, most notably the expansion of the historic Mena House Hotel overlooking the Giza Pyramids.

In this context, Mostafa Khidr, General Manager of the Fraud Combating and Financial Crimes Centralized Department at the CBE, stated that the programme represents a strategic opportunity to enhance awareness and build a shared understanding of various fraud practices and the frameworks for combating banking fraud. He emphasized that the programme supports faster response mechanisms, the application of effective mitigation techniques, and the establishment of a clear and unified definition of banking fraud.
Khidr further stressed that fraud combating is a shared responsibility rather than an individual effort, noting that while the implementation of robust policies, procedures, and internal controls is essential, their effectiveness depends on the awareness, vigilance, and commitment of institutions, their employees, and their customers alike.

For his part, Abdel Aziz Nossier, Executive Director of the EBI, highlighted that the launch of the new training programme marks another milestone in ongoing efforts to strengthen the capabilities of banking professionals. He noted that the program—developed under the supervision of the CBE—aims to equip participants with essential knowledge and practical skills to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. Nossier also underscored that investment in human capital development is a cornerstone of building a more secure and sustainable banking sector.
The newly launched programme is designed to enhance the capacity of banking sector employees to detect and mitigate fraud risks. It targets professionals across various specializations and job levels within the banking industry. Throughout the program, participants will be introduced to different types of fraud that may affect bank employees or customers, along with effective methods to prevent such attempts. The curriculum also highlights the impact of fraud on the banking sector through real-life case studies and outlines the appropriate actions to be taken when a fraudulent incident is discovered or suspected.",358,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.694126307964325,2025-12-30T09:28:28.991475

Standing before thousands of conservative activists at the annual AmericaFest, the widow of the late Charlie Kirk made a declaration that few in the room doubted: she was ready to see her husband’s friend, Vice President JD Vance, become the 48th President of the United States.

The Loyalty Test
Building the War Chest
The MAGA Peacekeeper
The 2028 Horizon
“We are going to get my husband’s friend, JD Vance, elected as 48 in the most resounding way possible,” she told the cheering crowd. The endorsement from the CEO of Turning Point USA—who stepped into the role after the assassination of her husband in September—was more than just a gesture of friendship; it was the clearest signal yet that the starting gun for the 2028 presidential cycle has been fired from within the heart of the White House.
Quietly but methodically, Vance has begun to sketch the contours of his own political future. According to sources familiar with his thinking and reports first detailed by Axios, the Vice President is executing a sophisticated, multi-track strategy. It is a delicate choreography that requires absolute loyalty to President Donald Trump today, while simultaneously building the financial and political machinery necessary to succeed him tomorrow.
By the time the 2026 midterm elections arrive, Vance intends to have transformed his office into a powerhouse of Republican patronage, positioning himself as the undisputed heir to the MAGA (Make America Great Again) mantle without ever appearing to outshine the man at the top.
The Loyalty Test
The first and most critical pillar of the Vance plan is the maintenance of an unbreakable bond with Trump. In a movement where the President’s approval is the ultimate currency, Vance has prioritised being seen as a “loyal lieutenant.”
William Martin, the Vice President’s communications director, has been explicit about this focus. “The Vice President has been very clear since taking office in January that his primary priority is helping President Trump deliver on his campaign promises,” Martin said. This involves public defence of even the President’s most controversial policies, ensuring that Vance remains the preferred choice of a base that remains fiercely protective of Trump’s legacy.
However, being the perfect No. 2 is a hazardous role. Trump has historically been wary of subordinates who seek too much of the limelight. To navigate this, Vance’s team is reportedly focused on 2026 as a bridge, allowing him to campaign for others and build his own brand under the guise of strengthening the President’s congressional majorities.
Building the War Chest
While loyalty wins votes, capital wins campaigns. Vance’s appointment as the finance chairman for the Republican National Committee (RNC) has provided him with a unique advantage. In this role, he has been crisscrossing the country to meet with top-tier donors, effectively locking in financial support years before a primary would begin.
While he enjoys deep-rooted connections with Silicon Valley billionaires, Vance is now focused on expanding his reach to traditional GOP fundraisers. By securing these commitments early, he aims to starve potential 2028 rivals—such as Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley—of the resources needed to launch a challenge.
This financial engine is complemented by a strategy of online dominance. Rather than engaging in public spats with rivals, Vance relies on a phalanx of influential conservative voices, including Donald Trump Jr. and Jack Posobiec, to fighthis corner in the digital arena.
The MAGA Peacekeeper
Internally, the MAGA movement has been rocked by fractures over issues ranging from foreign policy to internal “purity tests.” Here, Vance has sought to position himself as a unifier. During his closing remarks at AmericaFest, he pointedly refused to participate in the “self-defeating” denunciations common in modern primary politics.
“I didn’t come with a list of names of conservatives to denounce,” Vance said, framing himself as a voice of unity against the political left rather than an arbiter of internal dogma. This approach is designed to ensure that no faction of the base feels alienated from him before the 2028 primaries even begin.
The 2028 Horizon
Current polling suggests the strategy is working. According to the Race to the White House national average, Vance holds a commanding lead among potential GOP contenders, garnering more than 45% of the vote. His nearest rivals—including Secretary of State Marco Rubio at 10.9%, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis at 9.4%, and Donald Trump Jr. at 8.6%—trail significantly.
The relationship with Rubio is particularly noteworthy. Vance has described the Secretary of State as his “best friend” within the administration, leading some, like Representative Mike Lawler, to speculate that the two could eventually form a joint ticket. “I think it’s more likely that you’ll have a Vance-Rubio ticket than anything else,” Lawler told CNN, noting that the Vice President currently has a “leg up” on the competition.
As Vance prepares to spend much of the coming year on the campaign trail for Republican candidates, he is not just fighting for a congressional majority. He is honing his rhetoric, deepening ties with local organisers, and cementing his status as the inevitable next step for the party.

2025-12-29,"Concessional financing offered to first 100,000 taxpayers joining simplified tax system",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/29/concessional-financing-offered-to-first-100000-taxpayers-joining-simplified-tax-system/,"Minister of Finance Ahmed Kouchouk said concessional financing will be provided to the first 100,000 taxpayers who join the simplified tax system, stressing that the move aims to support taxpayers, ease compliance, and help businesses expand.
Speaking during a Monday panel discussion at the Egyptian Centre for Economic Studies, Kouchouk said that sample-based audits will be applied to tax returns this year. He added that penalties will be capped at the value of the principal tax amount, and announced plans to establish three specialised tax centres through which the e-Tax system will deliver easier and more advanced services using the latest automation tools.
Kouchouk said he welcomed the professional, candid and balanced dialogue with business leaders and representatives, noting that it reflected the most pressing challenges facing the private sector. “Our economic vision is based on openness, simplification and the creation of new horizons for competition and export opportunities for all companies operating in Egypt,” he said.
He added that the government is focusing on supporting sectors and activities in which Egypt has a competitive advantage, providing them with appropriate forms of support. In this context, he said the state is targeting a larger and more impactful role for the private sector to lead economic growth, create jobs and generate sustainable additional income.
The finance minister noted that rebuilding trust with the business community depends on delivering tangible and effective improvements in tax, customs and real estate-related services. He said the government is engaging with the private sector using a new approach based on effective incentives, pointing to the strong response to the first package of tax facilitations.
Kouchouk explained that the second package of tax facilitations is being developed in line with proposals submitted by committed partners through ongoing community dialogue. The package includes replacing capital gains tax on trading with a stamp duty, alongside other incentives to encourage company listings on the Egyptian Exchange; simplifying and accelerating VAT refund procedures; allowing set-off against credit balances; launching a mobile application for real estate transactions; and fixing the real estate transaction tax at 2.5% of the unit’s sale value for individuals, regardless of the number of transactions.
Additional measures include reducing VAT on medical devices from 14% to 5% and launching an electronic advisory platform to provide taxpayers with accurate and timely technical guidance.
The minister also said that ten facilitations are being targeted within the real estate tax system to simplify procedures and ease burdens on citizens and investors. These include raising the exemption threshold for private residences to EGP 4m, allowing tax write-offs where warranted, submitting a single simplified tax return regardless of the number of properties owned, and recognising electronic payment methods.
Kouchouk noted that the Ministry of Finance is coordinating with the Ministry of Investment to implement clear measures to improve the trade system, reduce customs clearance times and support industry and exports. These measures include customs facilitations to stimulate transit trade, the introduction of a comprehensive risk management system, new incentives for participants in the Authorised Economic Operator programme, and the unification and acceleration of customs procedures across all ports to boost foreign trade activity.
He stressed that the government is also working to remove what he described as a “black cloud” weighing on development efforts, through impactful measures aimed at reducing the size and burden of debt related to budgetary entities.
For his part, Deputy Minister for Tax Policies Sherif El-Kilany said the Advance Cargo Information (ACI) system was instrumental in enabling rapid progress towards customs facilitation measures. He noted that modernising the customs system helps reduce clearance times, strengthen governance and enhance the competitiveness of the Egyptian economy.
Omar Mohanna, Chairperson of the Egyptian Centre for Economic Studies, expressed appreciation for the ongoing tax transformation aimed at building a partnership with the business community based on trust and certainty, adding that he looks forward to completing this reform path to achieve tangible improvements in tax services.
Meanwhile, Abla Abdel Latif, Executive Director and Director of Research at the Centre, said that, at the request of the Ministry of Finance, the Centre is currently preparing a comprehensive and independent evaluation of the outcomes of the first package of tax reforms. She noted that this marks the first time a neutral research institution has undertaken an assessment of government performance on this scale.
Abdel Latif called on other institutions to adopt similar independent evaluation approaches to ensure efficiency, transparency and a clearer understanding of the real impact of economic policies on the business environment.",749,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.812461793422699,2025-12-30T09:28:46.716590
2025-12-29,Egypt’s apparel exports exceed $3bn for first time,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/29/egypts-apparel-exports-exceed-3bn-for-first-time/,"Egypt’s ready-made garments sector has achieved a historic milestone, with exports surpassing $3bn for the first time, according to the Apparel Export Council of Egypt (AECE).
The council said total garment exports reached approximately $3.1bn between January and November 2025, marking the highest level ever recorded by the industry. This represents annual growth of 22%, up from $2.5bn in 2024.
Fadel Marzouk, Chairperson and CEO of the AECE, said the record-breaking performance capped a year of exceptional growth driven by substantial development within the domestic industry and capacity expansions by existing Egyptian factories, which currently account for 63% of total garment exports.
Marzouk noted that the achievement is particularly significant as it was realised entirely through the capabilities and expansion of existing factories, highlighting the efficiency, resilience and global competitiveness of Egyptian-made apparel.
He added that the milestone was reached before the full impact of major new foreign investments, many of which are still in preparation or trial-operation phases.
According to Marzouk, export data reflect sustained and progressive improvement in the performance of exporting factories throughout the year, while the Export Council’s strategy to expand Egypt’s presence in international markets played a pivotal role in driving growth.
He also highlighted the Egyptian government’s strong commitment and concrete measures to support exports and push them towards record-breaking levels.
Marzouk said the direct impact of new investments—and the significant production capacities they will add—is expected to be clearly reflected in export figures during 2026 and 2027. These expansions, he added, will boost export-oriented production and further strengthen Egypt’s position as a leading regional hub for the apparel industry.
He projected that garment exports could exceed $4bn for the first time in the coming period, supported by the integration of existing industrial expertise with advanced technologies introduced by incoming investments. This aligns with the state’s broader strategy to expand non-oil exports and increase foreign currency inflows.
Marzouk affirmed continued coordination with relevant government authorities to overcome production challenges and ensure an attractive investment climate that encourages further capital inflows—supporting the sustainability of this historic growth and reinforcing the apparel sector’s role within Egypt’s national economy.
On a monthly basis, garment exports in November 2025 rose by 18% year-on-year to $281m. February recorded the highest monthly growth rate at 30%, while July registered the highest export value, with shipments reaching $326m.",387,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.954874873161316,2025-12-30T09:28:49.459290

The increase of $707m represents year-on-year growth of 13%.

Key export destinations
Commodity performance
In a statement, the Council said the performance confirms the sector’s position as a key pillar of Egypt’s non-oil exports, accounting for approximately 14% of total non-petroleum exports and ranking third among the country’s largest exporting sectors.
Resilience despite global economic headwinds
Mahmoud Bazan, chairperson of the Food Export Council, said the positive indicators recorded through the end of November 2025 reflect the effectiveness of state policies aimed at supporting production and boosting exports. He added that the sector has demonstrated a strong capacity to maintain sustainable growth despite continued global economic uncertainty.
Bazan noted that the consistent achievement of record export levels signals a qualitative shift in the structure of Egypt’s food exports, supported by wider product diversification, higher value-added manufacturing and the expansion of export destinations.
Stronger presence in advanced markets
The FEC chairperson highlighted notable growth in exports to the United States and the European Union, among the world’s most tightly regulated food markets in terms of safety and technical standards.
He said the sustained expansion in these markets provides clear evidence of improvements across Egypt’s food manufacturing system, including higher production efficiency and full compliance with US and European regulatory requirements. This progress, he added, has strengthened confidence among international importers in the quality and safety of Egyptian food products.
Bazan also stressed that the sector’s performance is contributing to increased foreign currency inflows and supporting the balance of payments, reflecting effective coordination between regulatory authorities, technical support bodies and export institutions.
Targets for full-year 2025
According to Bazan, the food industries sector is targeting exports of around $6.8bn by the end of 2025, representing an increase of no less than $700m compared with 2024 and a growth rate of approximately 12%.
He said this outlook is supported by strong performance in the final quarter of the year and growing global demand for Egyptian food products certified under an integrated national regulatory framework.
Key export destinations
Data released by the Food Export Council show that Arab countries remained the largest importing markets for Egyptian food products between January and November 2025, with imports valued at $3.127bn, representing 49% of total exports. This marked growth of 4%, or an increase of $130m, compared with the same period last year.
The European Union ranked second, with exports totalling $1.263bn, accounting for 20% of total exports, and recording growth of 15%, equivalent to an increase of $168m. Exports to non-Arab African markets reached $469m, representing 8% of total exports, with performance broadly unchanged year on year.
Exports to the United States recorded particularly strong growth, reaching $402m, an increase of 35%, or $105m. Meanwhile, exports to the rest of the world amounted to $1.077bn, posting robust growth of 40%, or $307m.
Commodity performance
Analysis of the commodity structure of food industry exports during the period shows continued strong performance across a wide range of products, reflecting the diversity of Egypt’s production base and rising demand for higher value-added food products.
Frozen strawberries led export growth, with shipments valued at $672m, compared with around $370m a year earlier, marking record growth of 81% and an increase of $302m, driven by rising demand in European and US markets.
Cola concentrate ranked second, with exports reaching $533m, recording growth of 5%, reflecting stable global demand and Egypt’s role as a key manufacturing hub.
Edible oils achieved strong growth, with exports rising to $405m, compared with around $285m in the previous year, posting growth of 42% and an increase of $119m, supported by stronger regional demand and expanded production capacity.
By contrast, sugar exports declined to $353m, down 6%, or $24m, reflecting global price volatility and shifting demand patterns. Preparations based on cereals and biscuits recorded exports of $340m, up 42%, or $100m, driven by rising demand in Arab and African markets for processed food products.
Flour and milling products fell to around $304m, recording a decline of 32%, or $145m, due to changes in import policies and weaker demand in some key markets. Frozen vegetables remained relatively stable at $240m, with growth of 1%, while frozen potatoes achieved growth of 16%, also reaching $240m, supported by increased demand from global retail and foodservice sectors.
Exports of prepared animal food products rose sharply to $231m, recording growth of 51%, as demand expanded in African and Asian markets. Chocolate exports reached $232m, up 45%, driven by stronger demand in Arab and African markets, while juice exports declined to $209m, down 21%, amid intensifying competition in several destinations.
Overall, the main food commodities accounted for around 89% of total Egyptian food industry exports during the first eleven months of 2025, with a combined value of $5.653bn out of total exports of $6.339bn, underscoring the sector’s strong export concentration and growing international footprint.",855,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9597265720367432,2025-12-30T09:29:07.755199

Ehab Wassef, Head of the Gold and Precious Metals Division, stated that the price of 21-karat gold rose by 4.59%, equivalent to EGP 265 per gram. Trading opened at EGP 5,775 per gram at the beginning of the week and closed at EGP 6,040 per gram, with prices ranging between a weekly low of EGP 5,775 and a high of EGP 6,040.
Wassef explained that the sharp rise in local gold prices was primarily driven by the historic rally in global gold markets, which has become the dominant pricing factor in Egypt amid the stability of the dollar exchange rate in banks and the absence of significant currency fluctuations. As a result, local gold price movements have closely mirrored changes in global ounce prices.
He added that global gold prices continued to rise for the third consecutive week, supported by increased demand for safe-haven assets amid escalating geopolitical tensions and a weakening US dollar, factors that were directly reflected in the local market.
The global price of gold rose by 4.5% over the past week, reaching a new all-time high of $4,550 per ounce. Trading opened at $4,340 per ounce and closed at $4,533 per ounce.
Wassef noted that global gold prices successfully broke through the psychological level of $4,500 per ounce, supported by strong upward momentum despite being in overbought territory. He indicated that prices are currently targeting the resistance level of $4,550 per ounce.
On the domestic front, Wassef said that 21-karat gold prices have stabilised above the EGP 6,000 per gram level after breaking through it over the past two days, supported by sufficient buying momentum. He added that the market is now anticipating a potential test of the EGP 6,050 per gram level in the coming period.
Wassef confirmed that geopolitical tensions were the main driver of gold’s performance during the week, particularly amid escalating disputes between the United States and Venezuela and continued US pressure on Venezuelan oil exports. These developments heightened concerns over supply disruptions and regional instability, prompting investors to increase their demand for gold as a safe-haven asset.",396,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9419028162956238,2025-12-30T09:29:13.027148

During the meeting, the Prime Minister stressed that entrepreneurship and support for startups are key drivers of economic growth and central pillars for achieving human development targets and the Sustainable Development Goals, which depend heavily on innovation across various economic and productive sectors. In this regard, he reaffirmed the government’s commitment to providing sustainable and comprehensive support for entrepreneurship through its relevant institutions.
For her part, Minister Al-Mashat outlined the results of ongoing coordination and intensive efforts by members of the Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship Advisory Committee and the Ministerial Group for Entrepreneurship. She highlighted the importance of policy integration across startups and scaleups, noting that such alignment is essential to building a strong and sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystem.
Al-Mashat explained that the Ministerial Group for Entrepreneurship has developed supportive policies targeting startups at the idea, establishment, and early growth stages, in line with Law No. 152 of 2020. She added that companies at the expansion, maturity, and exit stages require tailored tools, policies, and different forms of support—issues addressed through the “Egypt Startup Charter,” which aims to promote entrepreneurship, growth-oriented policies, and job creation within an integrated framework for startup development.
The Minister also noted that a series of meetings were held between the advisory committee, working groups, and startups to gather proposals and incorporate them into the Entrepreneurship Charter.
During the meeting, Al-Mashat reviewed a package of initiatives and policies that are ready for launch by the Ministerial Group for Entrepreneurship. These include the adoption of a unified definition of startups; a unified financing initiative; the establishment of an executive implementation mechanism; a dedicated scaleups program; a unified government services guide for startups (Navigator); the creation of a central communication point and dedicated website; and the launch of an Entrepreneurship Observatory.
She further referred to several government measures that have already been announced, including the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency (MSMEDA) and the “Erada” initiative to enhance the regulatory and legislative environment for entrepreneurship and SMEs; the approval by the Financial Regulatory Authority to establish Egypt’s first digital platform for investment in real estate investment fund certificates; and a strategic partnership between the Egyptian Intellectual Property Authority and the Innovators Support Fund to promote innovation.

The project is chaired by Kotb Mokhtar, with executive management led by Mohamed Hamdy, chief executive officer, and Ahmed Abdel Rahman, chief commercial officer.
Mokhtar said the project enjoys a strategic location near the Cairo–Alexandria Desert Road, El Nozha Street, Sphinx International Airport and the Grand Egyptian Museum, placing it within one of Sheikh Zayed’s fast-developing districts.
Naseem compound is being developed across 8.5 feddans, with a construction footprint of 27%, while the remaining area is dedicated to landscaped green spaces and artificial water features.

2025-12-28,Madbouly outlines new legislative framework to regulate Egypt’s real estate market,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/28/madbouly-outlines-new-legislative-framework-to-regulate-egypts-real-estate-market/,"Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said the government is working on a new legislative and institutional framework to better regulate Egypt’s real estate market, with the aim of enforcing market discipline, protecting citizens’ rights and supporting serious, financially capable developers.
Speaking last week, Madbouly said the government, in coordination with the Ministry of Housing and a group of leading real estate developers, is preparing what he described as a “filtering mechanism” for the sector. The proposed framework is designed to prevent major projects from being awarded to developers that lack the technical or financial capacity to deliver them.
Under the new system, real estate developers would be classified according to their financial solvency and execution track record, ensuring companies do not undertake projects beyond their capabilities. Madbouly said the classification would help safeguard buyers’ funds, reduce execution risks and prevent delays or project failures that could undermine market confidence.
The prime minister stressed that the forthcoming legislation seeks to strike a balanced approach between the interests of developers, citizens and the state. It aims to protect customers from delayed handovers or failure to meet agreed specifications, while preserving the state’s right to implement its urban development plans. At the same time, the framework is intended to support serious developers by simplifying procedures and enabling expansion under a clear and stable regulatory environment.
Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly
Addressing concerns over market conditions, Madbouly dismissed claims of a slowdown in the real estate sector, noting that property sales in 2025 exceeded those recorded in previous years. He said the sector continues to function as a safe store of value, with buying and selling activity remaining resilient despite inflationary pressures and wider economic challenges.
Madbouly also pointed to progress in establishing a unified real estate registration system through the national real estate identification number. He said coordination is underway with developers to list projects on the official Egypt Real Estate Platform, which aims to facilitate property sales to foreign investors and Egyptians living abroad, particularly in foreign currency, as part of efforts to boost real estate exports.
His remarks coincided with the Central Bank of Egypt’s recent decision to cut interest rates by 100 basis points, a move that government officials and market experts say could provide a boost to the real estate sector. Lower borrowing costs are expected to ease financing pressures on developers and stimulate mortgage lending, supporting demand in the period ahead.
Madbouly concluded that the government remains committed to building a more organised, transparent and sustainable real estate market that underpins long-term urban development while protecting investors, developers and citizens alike.",431,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.4945218563079834,2025-12-30T09:30:07.373875

El-Khatib affirmed the strong fraternal ties binding the two countries and their shared commitment to strengthening economic relations in line with their mutual aspirations. He reiterated Egypt’s readiness to support Sudan during its economic recovery phase by forging strategic partnerships and enhancing trade and investment linkages.
The minister stressed the importance of the committee’s regular convening, as well as sustained communication and coordination between the Egyptian and Sudanese sides at both governmental and private-sector levels, noting that such cooperation would help accelerate implementation and advance the two countries’ economic objectives.
For her part, Yaqoub said the committee’s meetings reflect the depth of relations between Egypt and Sudan and demonstrate the two countries’ willingness to join forces and pool efforts to achieve economic integration. She highlighted the need to further develop trade and investment relations, increase trade exchange, and expand cooperation in expertise-sharing and training in a manner commensurate with the close ties between the peoples of the Nile Valley and their shared interests.
Yaqoub also called for continued coordination and joint action to remove obstacles hindering the growth of bilateral trade, in line with the significant economic potential of both countries.
At the conclusion of the meetings, the two ministers signed the minutes of the committee’s proceedings, which included agreements across a number of priority areas. Both sides praised the existing level of economic cooperation between Cairo and Khartoum and stressed the importance of intensifying joint efforts to raise bilateral trade to levels that reflect the two countries’ potential and integration opportunities.
They noted that trade exchange between Egypt and Sudan reached approximately $1.15bn in 2024 and agreed to take all necessary measures to further increase trade volumes in a manner that meets the aspirations of both nations.
The two sides agreed on a package of measures and executive programmes to enhance economic integration, including the formation of a technical working group to boost trade exchange and identify priorities for merchandise trade. They also agreed to study a draft memorandum of understanding between Egypt’s General Authority for Investment and Free Zones and Sudan’s National Investment Authority to strengthen investment cooperation and facilitate the transfer of Egyptian expertise, particularly in free-zone management and the implementation of the one-stop-shop mechanism.
In addition, the two sides agreed to grant priority to Egyptian companies in Sudan’s reconstruction projects. Egypt also pledged to provide technical support to restart Sudanese factories damaged by the war and to begin training Sudanese customs personnel starting next January.

2025-12-28,Japan provides EGP 1bn grant to Egypt for Suez Canal diving support vessel,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/28/japan-provides-egp-1bn-grant-to-egypt-for-suez-canal-diving-support-vessel/,"Japan will provide an EGP 1bn ($22m) grant to Egypt to build and supply a first-of-its-kind diving support vessel (DSV) for the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) fleet, according to an executive agreement signed on Sunday.
The grant, provided through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), is intended to enhance maritime safety, emergency response, and the sustainable operation of the waterway. The signing ceremony was attended by Rania Al-Mashat, Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation, and Admiral Osama Rabie, Chairperson of the SCA. The agreement was signed by Ahmed El-Barbary, Director of the SCA Shipyards Department, and Yamamoto Atsushi, Senior Representative of the JICA Egypt Office, in the presence of Yusuke Suzuki, Economic Minister at the Japanese Embassy.
The DSV will perform multiple tasks, including towing, assisting ships in manoeuvring, and responding to maritime emergencies. Al-Mashat stated the agreement represents a qualitative partnership reflecting deep-rooted ties between the two nations, following directives from President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to benefit from Japanese developmental and technological expertise.
Al-Mashat noted that the Suez Canal handles approximately 12% of global trade and remains a primary component of Egypt’s gross domestic product. She added that while regional tensions since October 2023 caused a significant decline in traffic, navigation activity recovered to record 8.6% growth in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, following a peace agreement sponsored by President al-Sisi and a gradual return to stability in the Red Sea.
Rabiee described the DSV as an “unprecedented addition” to the SCA fleet that would significantly support marine rescue teams in diving, search, and recovery operations. He noted that the canal’s rescue capacity will be further bolstered next year with the addition of two rescue tugs with a 190-tonne bollard pull.
Suzuki, the Japanese Embassy’s economic minister, said the project is mutually beneficial and adds a new chapter to the strategic partnership. Atsushi, of JICA, highlighted that the partnership between JICA and the SCA has spanned nearly 70 years, stating the new vessel would reinforce the canal’s strategic position as a global maritime corridor.
The 45-metre vessel will be built entirely in Japan according to SOLAS requirements and under the supervision of the Japanese classification society NK. The 620-tonne unit features a dual-fuel engine (diesel and natural gas) to reduce carbon emissions.

2025-12-30,"CBE, Afreximbank sign MoU to launch pan-African Gold Bank programme in Egypt",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/30/cbe-afreximbank-sign-mou-to-launch-pan-african-gold-bank-programme-in-egypt/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and the African Export–Import Bank (Afreximbank) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish a pan-African Gold Bank programme, a strategic initiative aimed at formalising gold value chains, strengthening central bank reserves, and reducing Africa’s reliance on foreign refining and trading hubs.
The landmark MoU was signed by CBE Governor Hassan Abdalla and Afreximbank President and Chairperson of the Board of Directors, George Elombi, during a ceremony held at the Central Bank of Egypt.
The proposed Gold Bank programme aligns with Egypt’s vision to expand strategic partnerships and deepen cooperation with African countries across multiple sectors, as well as Afreximbank’s mandate to promote value addition and accelerate strategic mineral processing across the continent.
The partnership reflects a shared commitment by both institutions to support domestic manufacturing, advance sustainable development, and strengthen regional financial and trade integration—laying the foundation for a more resilient and sophisticated African economic ecosystem.
Under the MoU, the CBE and Afreximbank will collaborate on commissioning a feasibility study to assess the technical, commercial, and regulatory requirements for developing an integrated Gold Bank ecosystem within a designated free zone in Egypt, with the participation of African countries. The initiative envisages the establishment of an internationally accredited gold refinery, secure vaulting facilities, and related financial and trading services.
Beyond Egypt, the programme is designed to expand across the continent, engaging governments, central banks, mining companies, and industry stakeholders to enhance institutional cooperation, harmonise best practices, and facilitate the sustainable trade of gold and associated services throughout Africa.
Commenting on the agreement, Hassan Abdalla emphasised that the initiative represents a foundational step towards a broader pan-African framework that could engage African governments, central banks, and market participants. He reaffirmed Egypt’s commitment to advancing initiatives that promote continental economic integration, noting that Egypt’s potential role as a hub—subject to the outcomes of the feasibility study and regulatory approvals—reflects strong confidence in its capacity to host major continental projects. He added that Egypt’s strategic location at the crossroads of Africa, the Middle East, and Europe positions it as a natural hub for regional gold trade and financial innovation.
Speaking at the signing ceremony, George Elombi underscored the joint commitment of both institutions to close collaboration, aligning resources and efforts to promote financial stability and support sustainable economic growth across Africa.
“This signing ceremony may appear simple, yet it carries profound economic implications for our continent,” Elombi said. “It is a bold declaration that Africa’s gold must serve African people. This MoU, which forms part of Afreximbank’s vision to ensure Africa’s resources benefit Africans, lays the foundation for an African Gold Bank that will fundamentally transform how we extract, refine, manage, value, store, and trade our gold. By retaining value on the continent and building gold reserves—as other major economies have done—we enhance resilience, reduce vulnerability to external shocks, strengthen currency stability and convertibility, and generate wealth within Africa.”
Afreximbank and the Central Bank of Egypt share a long-standing partnership, with Egypt serving as both the Bank’s host country and its largest shareholder.",507,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8387256860733032,2025-12-31T09:29:22.382303

These ratings are consistent with those assigned to the corresponding tranches in the previous issuance, underscoring the stability of Reefy’s financing portfolio and the robustness of the issuance’s credit structure.

2025-12-31,From Niche to National Asset: Inside the Egyptian Golf Federation’s Institutional Rebirth,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/12/31/from-niche-to-national-asset-inside-the-egyptian-golf-federation-institutional-rebirth/,"On the manicured fairways of Madinaty, players from 35 different countries gathered this autumn for the return of the Egyptian Open for Professionals. For the local golf community, the event was more than just a tournament; it marked the end of a 15-year hiatus and signaled a profound shift in how the North African nation views a sport once dismissed as a peripheral, elitist pursuit.
The Egyptian Golf Federation, under the chairmanship of Omar Hisham Talaat Moustafa, has spent 2025 dismantling that stereotype. Through a combination of infrastructure overhaul, international regulatory alignment, and a hard-nosed approach to financial sustainability, the Federation has transformed golf into a high-yield platform for both national pride and economic growth.
The “kernel” of this transformation lies in a strategic pivot toward sports tourism. By hosting five major international championships in rapid succession this year, the EGF has effectively placed Egypt back on the global golfing map, using the sport as a tool to support the state’s ambitious goal of attracting 30m tourists annually by 2030.
Egyptian Golf Federation’s Economic Independence and Media Momentum
Financially, the Federation has broken new ground. For the first time, the EGF recorded a historic surplus of approximately 7m EGP. This milestone was achieved by diversifying self-generated resources and securing strategic sponsorship deals, moving the organization toward a model of financial independence that is increasingly seen as a benchmark for other national sports bodies.
This economic
success
was bolstered by a massive spike in visibility. A strategic partnership with the ON Sports network, sponsored by United Sports Company, brought the game to the masses. Live broadcasts garnered over 5m views across sports channels and social media platforms in October and November alone.
“Golf in Egypt is no longer viewed as a niche sport or a marginal activity,” the Federation noted in its year-end review, citing a 30% increase in the official practitioner base and a doubling of unofficial participation.
Golf: A Growing Footprint
The physical landscape of the sport is also expanding. Egypt now boasts between 25 and 30 golf courses that are either operational, under construction, or in the planning stages. This infrastructure serves as the backbone for an intensive tournament calendar that, in just two months, drew over 350 players from 70 countries.
The geographic diversity of these events—spanning from the urban landscapes of New Giza and Dreamland to the coastal beauty of Sokhna Golf on the Red Sea—is a deliberate move to showcase the country’s varied tourism offerings. In the final quarter of the year, these events generated more than 2,000 hotel room nights, providing a direct injection into the local hospitality sector.
The Road to 2032
Looking ahead, the Federation is shifting its focus toward technical excellence and long-term talent development. The appointment of world-renowned expert Stuart Clayton as Technical Director for the national teams signals an intent to move beyond hosting and into the realm of producing world-class competitors.
The ultimate target is clear: the cultivation of an Egyptian Olympic champion, with a roadmap specifically designed for the 2032 Olympic Games. To bridge the gap to professional competition, the EGF has signed a strategic partnership with the
MENA Golf Tour
to resume the “Egypt Golf Series.” This initiative includes four major tournaments scheduled for January and February 2026, with total prize money reaching $400,000.
The international community has taken note of this rapid ascent. Omar Hisham Talaat’s recent election to the Executive Board of the Arab Golf Federation for the 2025–2029 term is viewed by analysts as a validation of Egypt’s restored regional stature.
As the Federation enters 2026, the focus remains on maintaining this momentum. With a professionalized technical system and a burgeoning tournament circuit, Egypt is no longer just playing the game—it is aiming to lead it.",623,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9166582226753236,2026-01-01T09:28:49.605351

2026-01-03,Gold slips at start of 2026 as thin liquidity triggers profit-taking: Gold Bullion,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/03/gold-slips-at-start-of-2026-as-thin-liquidity-triggers-profit-taking-gold-bullion/,"Gold prices retreated in the first trading sessions of 2026, pulling back from recent record highs amid thin market liquidity and profit-taking, according to an analysis by Gold Bullion.
Spot gold declined 4.4% over the past week, falling to a two-week low of $4,274 per ounce after opening the week at $4,542. Prices later recovered some losses, ending the week at $4,332 per ounce, the firm’s technical analysis showed.
The metal entered 2026 following a sharp rally in 2025, when prices surged nearly 65% year-on-year—marking gold’s strongest annual performance since 1979.
That rally was fueled in part by expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates, with markets currently pricing in two rate cuts during 2026. Lower interest rates typically reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as gold, making the metal more attractive to investors.
Additional support over the past year came from a weaker U.S. dollar and easing inflation concerns, both of which boosted demand for gold.
Geopolitical risks remain a potential catalyst for renewed safe-haven buying. Reports of repeated attacks in Venezuela’s capital—believed by some sources to involve U.S. action—could support gold demand once markets return to full activity next week, the analysis noted.
Gold Bullion attributed the recent volatility primarily to reduced liquidity and lower trading volumes during the holiday period, which weakened upward momentum and encouraged profit-taking. Despite the pullback, prices have so far remained above the $4,300 per ounce level.
Market views on gold’s short-term outlook remain divided. Some analysts warn that prices may be entering overbought territory following last year’s rally, increasing the risk of a near-term correction. Others highlight continued central bank purchases as a key source of underlying support, citing ongoing diversification of foreign exchange reserves into gold.
Physical demand showed signs of improvement in Asia after the recent price correction. In India, dealers charged premiums of up to $15 per ounce over official domestic prices this week, compared with a discount of $61 per ounce last week. In China, prices shifted from a discount to a premium of around $3 per ounce above the global spot benchmark, reflecting improved consumer demand.",356,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.7867401242256165,2026-01-04T09:24:42.659126
2026-01-03,Madbouly inspects Luxor healthcare facilities as Universal Insurance expands in Upper Egypt,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/03/madbouly-inspects-luxor-healthcare-facilities-as-universal-insurance-expands-in-upper-egypt/,"Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly conducted an extensive field tour of healthcare facilities affiliated with Egypt’s Healthcare Authority (EHA) in Luxor, as part of ongoing efforts to monitor the implementation of the Universal Health Insurance System (UHIS) and evaluate progress in healthcare services across Upper Egypt.
The tour included visits to Karnak International Hospital and Luxor International Medical Complex—two flagship institutions operating under the comprehensive health insurance framework. The inspection came within the broader context of the Prime Minister’s tour of development and service projects in Luxor, underscoring the government’s commitment to expanding equitable access to high-quality healthcare, particularly in Upper Egypt, which has historically faced service gaps.
Major Investments in Healthcare
Luxor Governor Abdel Motaleb Emara highlighted the significant impact of state-led healthcare investments under the Universal Health Insurance project. He noted that Luxor was the first governorate in Upper Egypt to implement the UHIS and the second nationwide after Port Said, marking a major milestone in Egypt’s healthcare reform journey.
According to Emara, total state investments in Luxor’s healthcare infrastructure have reached EGP 13.5bn, supporting the development of six hospitals, 59 primary healthcare units, and one medical center. These investments have helped eliminate treatment waiting lists, enhance service quality, and provide advanced medical care locally, reducing the need for patients to seek treatment outside the governorate.
Expanding Capacity and Advanced Services
Chairperson of the Egypt Healthcare Authority Ahmed El-Sobky stated that 2025 witnessed the largest package of medical expansions ever implemented across EHA facilities in Luxor. These expansions are part of a comprehensive plan to modernize infrastructure, introduce advanced medical specialties, and ensure compliance with internationally recognized quality standards under the UHIS.
El-Sobky noted that Luxor’s healthcare facilities have undergone a qualitative transformation, with several specialized services introduced for the first time in the governorate, significantly enhancing hospitals’ capacity to manage complex and critical cases.
To date, EHA facilities in Luxor have delivered millions of medical and therapeutic services through a network of 60 healthcare facilities, including six hospitals, 11 medical centers, and 43 primary care units. Luxor also hosts its first “green pharmacy,” while 59 healthcare facilities—representing 98% of facilities in the governorate—have obtained accreditation under the nationally and internationally recognized GAHAR standards.
A Growing Universal Health Insurance System
El-Sobky revealed that more than 1.2 million beneficiaries currently receive healthcare services in Luxor under the UHIS. The governorate’s healthcare capacity includes 896 inpatient beds, 242 ICU beds, 111 neonatal incubators, 241 dialysis machines, 41 operating rooms, and 10 MRI and CT scan units.
Plans are underway to bring additional facilities into service in 2026, including New Qurna Hospital, the third and fourth phases of Luxor International Medical Complex, and several new medical centers and family medicine units. Workforce sustainability is also being strengthened through six nursing institutes in Luxor, with a total enrollment of 2,320 students.
Among the advanced medical services introduced in Luxor for the first time are deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgeries—costing up to EGP 1.6m per case—endoscopic ultrasound procedures for gallbladder and pancreatic tumors, cochlear implants, complex pediatric bronchoscopy, free-flap skin grafts for severe injuries, and advanced vascular interventions such as EVAR and TEVAR.
Since operations began and through November 2025, Luxor hospitals have delivered more than 17.5 million medical services. Surgical procedures performed in 2025 alone reached 45,369 operations, while primary healthcare services exceeded 11 million. Facilities have also played a key role in presidential health initiatives addressing chronic diseases, women’s health, maternal and fetal care, and early disease detection.
Karnak International Hospital
During his visit to Karnak International Hospital, Prime Minister Madbouly inspected multiple departments to assess the availability of medical supplies and the efficiency of patient care. El-Sobky described the hospital as a cornerstone of medical tourism in Upper Egypt, citing its advanced infrastructure and internationally competitive services.
The hospital has a capacity of 149 inpatient beds, 39 ICU beds, 44 dialysis machines, 10 neonatal incubators, and seven operating rooms. In 2025, ICU capacity expanded from 21 to 39 beds, and a new oncology unit featuring 12 chemotherapy chairs was inaugurated. The hospital also introduced intermediate care services and performed advanced brain tumor surgeries using state-of-the-art equipment.
El-Sobky added that the oncology unit was equipped according to the latest global standards, supported by advanced linear accelerators and highly trained medical teams.
The Prime Minister held informal discussions with patients in several departments, including oncology and neonatal care. Patients praised the quality of services, with one elderly cancer patient describing the care as “excellent—ten out of ten.”
El-Sobky highlighted a case illustrating the UHIS impact: a six-year-old girl underwent a surgery costing EGP 3.6m, while her family paid only EGP 428, with the state covering the remaining cost.
Luxor International Medical Complex
Madbouly also inspected Luxor International Medical Complex, which El-Sobky described as the “icon of healthcare in Luxor” and the primary referral center for complex cases across Upper Egypt. The complex offers advanced services including burn care, open-heart surgery, bone marrow transplantation, gastrointestinal oncology endoscopy, and complex orthopedic procedures.
The facility comprises 373 inpatient beds, 57 ICU beds, 26 incubators, 13 operating rooms, 22 dialysis beds, and advanced imaging units. Since its inauguration, the complex has delivered approximately 1.67 million medical services and performed nearly 33,000 surgeries.
Residents told the Prime Minister that prior to the complex’s opening, patients often had to travel to Assiut or other governorates and wait weeks for surgery—burdens that have now been eliminated.
Concluding his tour, Prime Minister Madbouly praised the quality of healthcare services provided under the Universal Health Insurance System in Luxor, reaffirming the government’s commitment to ensuring that citizens in Upper Egypt receive integrated, high-quality medical care within their home governorates, in line with international standards.",942,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9012484550476074,2026-01-04T09:24:52.777152

During a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence, Trump declared that the United States will “run” Venezuela on a temporary basis to oversee what he described as a “judicious transition” of power.

Maduro En Route to New York
Venezuela Demands “Proof of Life”
International Alarm and Condemnation
Background: A Final Confrontation
The operation, which Trump characterised as “Operation Midnight Hammer,” involved a massive coordination of air, land, and sea power. The President stated that Maduro was seized from a “fortress” in the heart of Caracas by members of the US military—reported to include the elite Delta Force—working alongside US law enforcement agencies.
“We Are Going to Run the Country”
Addressing reporters, Trump announced a period of direct US involvement in Venezuelan governance. “We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition,” Trump said.5″We don’t want to be involved with having somebody else get in, and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years.”
The President also signalled an immediate focus on Venezuela’s oil sector, claiming that major US oil companies would be deployed to “fix the badly broken infrastructure” and invest “billions of dollars” to restore production.6 “The oil business has been a bust,” Trump noted. “We’re going to start making money for the country.”
Despite reports of heavy explosions across Caracas, Trump stated that the mission resulted in no US fatalities and no loss of American equipment. “It was an incredible thing to see,” he remarked, describing the Venezuelan military as being “completely overwhelmed and very quickly incapacitated.” He added that while a second, larger wave of attacks was planned, it would likely be unnecessary due to the “pinpoint” success of the initial strikes.
Maduro En Route to New York
The US Department of Justice confirmed that Maduro and his wife are currently in US custody. Trump later clarified in an interview that the couple had been transported to the USS Iwo Jima and are being flown to New York to face criminal charges. Maduro was indicted in 2020 on charges of narco-terrorism and leading the “Cartel of the Suns.”
Venezuela Demands “Proof of Life”
The Venezuelan government, led by Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, has yet to acknowledge the capture. In an emergency broadcast, Rodriguez stated that the government remains unaware of the president’s location and demanded that Washington provide “proof that President Maduro and his wife are alive.”
Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello confirmed civilian casualties resulting from the strikes on the capital and called for national resistance. “They expected the people to flee in hysteria,” Cabello said, urging citizens to trust the national leadership despite the “cowardly” attacks on military and civilian zones.
International Alarm and Condemnation
The escalation has triggered a global diplomatic crisis:
Russia and Mexico: Both nations issued sharp condemnations, with Moscow labelling the raid an “armed act of aggression” and Mexico City citing a violation of the UN Charter.
China: Said it is “deeply shocked” by the US’s military strikes on Venezuela and its capture of President Nicolas Maduro, strongly condemns the US’s blatant use of force against a sovereign state and action against its president,” a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement late Saturday.
The United Nations: Secretary-General António Guterres expressed “deep concern” regarding the respect for international law, while the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry has requested an urgent Security Council meeting.
European Union: Foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas emphasised that “international law must be respected,” even while acknowledging Maduro’s lack of democratic legitimacy.
Background: A Final Confrontation
The capture of Maduro marks the most significant US military intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama. Maduro, who began a controversial third term in January 2025, has long framed his presidency as a “battle for sovereignty” against US imperialism. Washington’s move to designate its government a “foreign terrorist organisation” in 2025 set the stage for Saturday’s military action, which Trump today described as “the hour of freedom” for the Venezuelan people.",703,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.6434465050697327,2026-01-04T09:25:25.757407

2026-01-04,Escrow accounts gain momentum as Egypt moves to enforce real estate discipline,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/04/escrow-accounts-gain-momentum-as-egypt-moves-to-enforce-real-estate-discipline/,"Egypt’s real estate sector is shifting decisively from regulatory debate to enforcement, as government authorities, parliament, and market stakeholders converge on the activation of escrow accounts as a central mechanism to restore discipline, protect buyers, and curb project delays.
The renewed momentum follows mounting complaints over delayed unit deliveries and instances of financial mismanagement in some developments, raising broader concerns about market governance, investor protection, and the sustainability of off-plan sales. Against this backdrop, escrow accounts are increasingly viewed as the cornerstone of a new regulatory phase for the sector—one focused on accountability rather than voluntary compliance.
Government Steps Up Oversight
Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly has repeatedly stressed, during cabinet meetings with the Real Estate Market Regulation Committee—which includes the Minister of Housing and the Chairperson of the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA)—that the state will not tolerate violations of rules governing off-plan sales.
According to statements from the Cabinet’s Media Office, the government is closely monitoring the enforcement of regulations obliging developers to open a dedicated escrow bank account for each project. Withdrawals from these accounts are tied to certified construction progress reports, ensuring that buyers’ funds are used exclusively for execution and building works.
In December 2025, Walid Abbas, Vice Chairperson of NUCA for Planning and Projects, said the authority had already begun reviewing developers’ bank statements to ensure full financial separation between projects operated by the same company, in line with Cabinet Decision No. 2184.
Earlier, in October 2025, Fathallah Fawzy, Head of the Real Estate Development Committee at the Egyptian Businessmen’s Association, warned that the delay in activating escrow accounts for nearly three years had contributed directly to current project distress cases. He called for an urgent transition from what he described as “paper-based decisions” to full on-ground implementation.
Parliament Pushes for Mandatory System
The Egyptian Senate has also entered the debate. In November 2025, lawmakers submitted a memorandum proposing a mandatory escrow system for every real estate project, with provisions allowing funds to be frozen in cases of severe developer default and redirected to complete construction through an alternative developer.
The proposal further calls for linking escrow accounts to a unified national digital platform, enabling buyers, regulators, and the Central Bank to track fund flows and construction progress in real time—introducing an unprecedented level of transparency to the sector.
Private Sector Initiatives and Pilot Models
From the private sector, Ahmed Elbatrawy, CEO of the Official Egyptian Real Estate Platform, revealed in December 2025 a proposal requiring developers to deposit 30% of a project’s total value in cash into escrow accounts prior to launching sales, as proof of financial solvency and seriousness.
In parallel, Farida Developments announced the actual implementation of an escrow system in cooperation with a major state-owned bank, positioning the initiative as a pilot for broader plans to transform real estate units into tradable instruments within a proposed real estate exchange.
Developers Urge Cost Considerations
Despite broad agreement on the need for regulation, concerns remain among developers. The Real Estate Development Chamber at the Federation of Egyptian Industries has warned that escrow accounts could increase administrative burdens and unit prices due to banking fees.
Executive Director Osama Saad El-Din said developers support market organisation but called for closer coordination with financial institutions to mitigate cost pressures and avoid passing additional expenses on to end buyers.
Business development consultant Abdelrahman Khalil argued that a strong and effective regulatory authority would help establish fair competition by rewarding compliant developers while forcing non-serious players to either correct their positions or exit the market.
He described escrow accounts as essential for safeguarding project funds and boosting investor confidence—particularly for foreign investors whose feasibility studies are often undermined by regulatory uncertainty.
Khalil added that the main challenges lie in cultural resistance to oversight and weak enforcement, rather than the absence of legislation. On legacy distressed projects, he stressed that new regulations should focus on preventing future crises, while existing cases should be resolved individually through current judicial mechanisms, without retroactive application of new rules.
Drawing comparisons with international models such as Dubai’s Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA), Khalil emphasised the need to adapt best practices to Egypt’s market size, financing structure, and development cycles.
From Advocacy to Enforcement
Between 2025 and 2026, a clear national consensus has emerged: escrow accounts are no longer optional but are becoming the primary tool to address delivery delays and restore trust in Egypt’s real estate market. The current phase marks a shift from advocating the concept to enforcing its mechanisms—whether through a proposed independent real estate regulator or a more empowered developers’ union—signalling a structural transformation in how the sector is governed.",770,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.7581831812858582,2026-01-05T09:34:34.044080
2026-01-04,Silver drops 4.6% in Egypt amid global sell-off triggered by margin hikes: Safe Haven Hub,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/04/silver-drops-4-6-in-egypt-amid-global-sell-off-triggered-by-margin-hikes-safe-haven-hub/,"Silver prices in Egypt declined by 4.6% last week, tracking a sharp global downturn of nearly 9% per ounce, according to a report by Safe Haven Hub. The sell-off followed a decision by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to raise trading margins on precious metals contracts, prompting heavy liquidation in the final trading sessions of 2025.
In the local market, the price of 999-grade silver fell from EGP 131 to EGP 125 per gram, while 925-grade silver declined to EGP 116 and 800-grade silver to EGP 100. The silver pound dropped to EGP 928. Globally, silver lost around $7.27 per ounce, opening the week at $79.27 and closing near $72 per ounce.
Despite the weekly decline, silver recorded exceptional gains over 2025, rising 145% locally and 148% globally. In Egypt, 999-grade silver began the year at EGP 51 per gram, peaked at EGP 136, and closed at EGP 125, while 925- and 800-grade silver ended the year at EGP 116 and EGP 100, respectively. Internationally, prices opened at $29 per ounce, surged to a historic high of $84, and settled near $72 by year-end.
Safe Haven Hub attributed the abrupt correction to the CME’s decision to raise margins twice within three days, a move that shocked markets and triggered widespread selling shortly after silver reached record highs.
While silver is not traditionally viewed as a currency, analysts argue it could assume a more central role in the global financial system, positioning it as a strategic asset amid intensifying competition between Western and Eastern markets over key commodities. Such dynamics could increasingly turn silver into a tool for price revaluation and financial hedging.
Historically, China absorbed between 30% and 50% of global silver production from the mid-16th to early 19th centuries, underpinning its monetary, fiscal, and trade systems. Today, China remains the world’s second-largest silver producer, a major refiner and exporter, and has recently imposed export restrictions aimed at strengthening control over global silver supply chains.
The report highlighted mounting pressure on global silver inventories driven by robust industrial demand and constrained supply. Limited primary deposits and heavy reliance on secondary production—mainly from copper, lead, zinc, and gold mining—now account for 72% of global supply. Industrial consumption reached a record 680 million ounces in 2024, led by renewable energy and artificial intelligence applications. Solar energy alone consumes more than 200 million ounces annually, a figure expected to exceed 450 million ounces by 2030.
Investment demand, particularly from India, has further tightened physical supply, while stagnant global inventories—largely unchanged for nearly 25 years—continue to strain the market. This imbalance has kept spot prices above futures, as investors pay premiums to secure physical metal.
Although futures markets such as COMEX may remain relatively stable, the physical silver market—especially London’s off-exchange segment—is facing its most severe disruption in decades. Elevated premiums reflect growing concerns over supply shortages, which are likely to intensify as Chinese export restrictions take effect.
Analysts maintain that silver’s fundamentals support a positive outlook for 2026 and beyond, underpinned by declining London inventories, inelastic industrial demand from the solar sector, reliance on secondary production, speculative activity, and strategic accumulation by major global powers.",522,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9525726437568665,2026-01-05T09:34:39.139645

2026-01-05,FRA launches first register for tech-based risk assessment firms in non-banking finance,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/05/fra-launches-first-register-for-tech-based-risk-assessment-firms-in-non-banking-finance/,"The Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA) has issued a decision establishing a dedicated register for companies that provide technology-driven risk assessment systems for non-banking financial activities, marking a significant step in regulating the use of advanced technologies within Egypt’s non-banking finance sector.
These companies rely on sophisticated technological tools, including artificial intelligence and digital data analytics, to assess credit and operational risks more efficiently and accurately. Such systems enable faster, data-driven decision-making and enhance risk evaluation processes across non-banking financial services.
Mohamed Farid, Chairperson of the FRA, said that introducing an organised regulatory framework governing technology-based risk assessment firms is a core pillar of the Authority’s strategy to develop an advanced legislative and supervisory environment that keeps pace with the rapid growth of Egypt’s non-banking fintech ecosystem.
Farid noted that over recent years the FRA has worked to democratise investment by expanding access to financial products across different segments of society. This has been achieved through the development of the investment funds sector and the introduction of diversified instruments, including crowdfunding platforms and gold investment funds, which have attracted a wide base of small-scale investors.
He added that the new framework aims to further democratise finance by leveraging technology in risk assessment for non-banking financial activities, enabling broader access to financing in a more secure, sustainable, efficient, and well-regulated manner.
Under FRA Board Decision No. 279 of 2025, a formal register will be established for companies providing technological systems for risk assessment in non-banking finance. The register will include key information such as the company’s name, legal form, head office address, details of the managing director or person responsible for management, and official contact information.
The decision prohibits non-banking financial companies and entities from dealing with unregistered risk assessment providers. It also requires non-banking finance companies to notify the FRA of their intention to contract with any registered provider prior to concluding an agreement and to submit a copy of the contract to the Authority.
At the same time, the decision allows non-banking financial companies and entities to use their own internal technological systems for risk assessment when granting financing, provided that such systems receive prior approval from the FRA.
The Authority has set out detailed eligibility criteria for registration. Applicants must include the provision of technological systems or technical solutions among their stated corporate objectives and must have issued and paid-up capital of no less than EGP 10m or its equivalent. Companies are also required to have at least three years of experience in the activity. Alternatively, eligibility may be satisfied if shareholders’ equity is no less than EGP 20m, or if at least 50% of the company is owned by a technology firm with a minimum of three years’ experience in the field. Applicants must submit audited financial statements prepared by an auditor registered with the FRA under the first section of the auditors’ register.
Registration applications must be accompanied by a digital business model, a detailed explanation of the methodologies and algorithms used, technical documentation of the technological infrastructure, a record of previous work, and proof of payment of an application review fee of EGP 25,000. The FRA is required to issue a decision on the application within 30 days from the date all requirements are fulfilled.
The registration will be valid for three years, with companies required to apply for renewal at least three months before the expiry date. The decision also grants existing technology-based risk assessment companies a six-month period from the effective date of the decision to regularise their status.
Registered companies will be subject to a set of ongoing obligations, including compliance with FRA decisions, enabling regulatory inspections, maintaining strict confidentiality of data, avoiding conflicts of interest, and submitting quarterly reports to the Authority on the outcomes of their activities.
In cases of non-compliance, the FRA may impose a range of regulatory measures, including written warnings, temporary suspension for up to one year, delisting with a ban on re-registration for periods ranging from six months to five years, or permanent removal from the register.
The FRA said the decision supports the digital transformation of the non-banking financial sector by regulating the use of technology in credit data analysis. It is expected to enhance risk management practices, expand access to non-banking finance for wider segments of society, and contribute to the sustainable growth and stability of non-banking financial activities.",724,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.8246389031410217,2026-01-07T09:32:06.610624
2026-01-05,Egyptian Women 2025: Assessing the Gap Between Policy and Practice,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/05/egyptian-women-2025-assessing-the-gap-between-policy-and-practice/,"The year 2025 has concluded, presenting a complex landscape for women’s rights in Egypt. According to the newly released annual report by the Egyptian Centre for Women’s Rights (ECWR), titled “Egyptian Women 2025: Rights Gaps and the Shadows of Violence,” the country continues to navigate a gap between its legislative frameworks and the practical experiences of its female citizens. While institutional structures remain active, the report identifies the year as a period of significant challenges, marked by persistent social barriers and safety concerns that impact the pursuit of full equality.

Safety and Public Space: Navigating Social Dynamics
A primary focus of the ECWR’s 2025 report is the ongoing prevalence of violence against women. The report observes that these incidents occur across both private and public spheres. Within the home, cases of domestic violence—sometimes resulting in fatalities—are often categorised under the umbrella of “family disputes,” a trend the report suggests requires more robust legal intervention. The documentation of violence affecting women early in marriage highlights a specific area of vulnerability that warrants further social study.
The report also addresses safety in public spaces, noting that harassment remains a significant hurdle for women’s freedom of movement. One specific instance cited involved a physical and verbal altercation on the Cairo Metro, where a young woman was confronted by a passenger regarding her public conduct. The ECWR characterises such incidents as part of a broader social pressure that can discourage women’s full participation in public life.
Political Representation and the Quota System
In the political arena, the 2025 elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate provided a clear look at the current state of female representation. Despite constitutional guarantees and mandated quotas, the report finds that women continue to face significant obstacles when running for individual seats outside of protected lists.
In the Senate elections, female representation was achieved exclusively through the closed-list system, with no women securing individual seats. The report suggests this is due to long-standing social norms and the difficulty of breaking into established political networks. The House elections followed a similar trend: of the 173 women contesting individual seats, only three were successful. Consequently, the majority of women in parliament entered via party lists—a process the report notes can sometimes be viewed as a procedural necessity rather than a reflection of competitive electoral gains.
The ECWR also evaluated the role of political parties, noting that many limited female participation to the minimum legal requirements. This has led to questions regarding whether the inclusion of women is being driven by a commitment to leadership diversity or simply by technical compliance with the law.
Economic Participation and Structural Barriers
Economically, the data suggest that Egyptian women remain underutilised in the workforce. Citing figures from the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics (CAPMAS), the report identifies a significant gender gap. While male labour force participation is at 70.3%, female participation stands at 16.9%. Furthermore, the female unemployment rate reached 17.1%, compared to a male rate of 4.2%.
The report posits that this economic disparity, coupled with social and political challenges, continues to affect Egypt’s performance in global development and gender parity metrics.
International Benchmarks and Comparative Rankings
The ECWR report includes an analysis of Egypt’s standing in various international indices. In the Global Gender Gap Report 2025, Egypt ranks 139th out of 148 countries. The sector-specific data shows the country at 145th in economic participation, 111th in health and wellbeing, 101st in political empowerment, and 78th in educational attainment—the latter being the country’s strongest area of performance.
Compared to 2024, Egypt’s overall ranking shifted from 135th to 139th, a move the ECWR identifies as a call for renewed focus on gender-centric policy reforms.
Human Development and the Impact of Inequality
The report also references the 2025 Human Development Report, which maintains Egypt’s classification as a country with “high human development,” with a score of 0.754 and a global rank of 100 out of 193. However, the ECWR notes that when adjusted for inequality, the country’s development value decreases by approximately 22.8%.
This is further reflected in the Gender Inequality Index (GII), where Egypt scores 0.398, ranking 101st globally. These figures highlight the ongoing need to address disparities in labour market access and reproductive health to ensure more balanced national growth.
Indicators of the Rule of Law
One of the report’s final sections examines Egypt’s performance in the 2025 Rule of Law Index. While Egypt possesses an established judicial history, its global ranking currently stands at 135th out of 143 countries.
The report notes low rankings in categories such as fundamental rights (141st) and constraints on government powers (141st). While the country performs relatively well in the “order and security” category, the ECWR emphasises that physical security is most effective when paired with advancements in civil rights and institutional accountability.
The Road Ahead
Ultimately, the ECWR report serves as an analytical look at the work remaining to be done. It suggests that the distribution of opportunities is inextricably linked to the strength of legal and institutional frameworks. While Egypt maintains stability and security, the report concludes that for women to achieve the full promise of citizenship, there must be a shift from symbolic representation toward substantive inclusion in all sectors of the public sphere.",910,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.5466088652610779,2026-01-07T09:32:54.121379
2026-01-05,"Industry Ministry rolls out incentive package to expand cold-rolled, coated steel production",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/05/industry-ministry-rolls-out-incentive-package-to-expand-cold-rolled-coated-steel-production/,"Egypt’s Ministry of Industry has unveiled a new package of investment incentives aimed at encouraging the establishment of factories producing cold-rolled, galvanised, and pre-painted steel sheets and coils, which are regarded as key inputs for a wide range of strategic industries.
In a statement, the ministry urged serious investors to direct new capital towards the sector, stressing that the incentives are structured to deliver mutual benefits for both investors and the state while supporting long-term industrial development.
Under the package, industrial land will be allocated at competitive prices, with priority given to projects operating in cold-rolled and coated steel production. Investors will also benefit from flexible payment mechanisms tied to clearly defined implementation schedules, alongside access to concessional financing to support production lines and working-capital requirements.
To fast-track project implementation, the ministry confirmed that operating licences will be issued within 24 hours of the completion of all required procedures and documentation through the General Authority for Industrial Development. Approved projects will also receive immediate access to essential utilities, including electricity, water, natural gas, roads, and telecommunications infrastructure.
In parallel, locally produced steel sheets will be prioritised in meeting the needs of national and mega development projects, a measure intended to strengthen domestic value chains and provide sustained demand for local manufacturers.
The ministry explained that the incentive package forms part of its broader strategy to build a strong and competitive industrial base capable of meeting domestic demand while enhancing Egypt’s ability to compete in regional and international markets. The initiative places particular emphasis on localising feeder industries, especially steel products that serve as core inputs for sectors such as home appliances, automotive and transport manufacturing, medical industries, metal packaging, steel construction, agricultural machinery, and metal furniture.
According to the ministry, expanding local production of cold-rolled and coated steel products will help reduce reliance on imports, improve supply-chain resilience, create new employment opportunities, and bolster Egypt’s overall industrial competitiveness.",318,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8377196788787842,2026-01-10T09:22:35.014335
2026-01-05,Egypt identifies 80 measures to overhaul startup environment and boost investment,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/05/egypt-identifies-80-measures-to-overhaul-startup-environment-and-boost-investment/,"Egypt has identified 80 specific measures to overhaul the entrepreneurship environment and boost investment in startups following a year-long review of the sector, Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation Rania Al-Mashat said on Monday.
The measures were formulated after 50 meetings involving 250 representative bodies and 160 startups, aiming to address feedback from both government agencies and the entrepreneurship community. Speaking during a meeting led by Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, Al-Mashat confirmed that the government is preparing to launch several initiatives, including a unified definition and classification for startups in accordance with Law No. 152 of 2020, a unified government guide for services, and a comprehensive financing initiative.
Prime Minister Madbouly stated during the session at the New Administrative Capital that the government is considering the establishment of a single, unified institutional body to oversee the sector. This proposed entity would act as a central reference point, merging the efforts of various ministries to resolve challenges and provide support. Madbouly noted that a specific charter for the sector has been finalised and that the government is working to activate decisions and procedures to advance the entrepreneurship file.
“We are working during the current period to activate a number of decisions and procedures that contribute to pushing the entrepreneurship file and advancing it,” Madbouly said, adding that the meeting focused on discussing the proposal for this unified institutional framework.
The planned reforms include a programme for startups in the maturity stage, the creation of a dedicated contact point and website, and the establishment of an observatory to monitor the implementation of entrepreneurship policies. Al-Mashat emphasised that the Ministerial Group for Entrepreneurship has adopted policies to support companies through every stage of development, including the initial idea phase, foundation, early growth, expansion, and maturity or exit. She added that companies in the expansion phase require specific tools and policies tailored to their growth needs.
Amr El-Abd, the Prime Minister’s Advisor for Entrepreneurship, outlined three strategic pillars for the sector, asserting that entrepreneurship is a primary driver of sustainable economic growth. The strategy focuses on enhancing coordination between authorities to address current challenges and positioning Egypt as a major player in the global entrepreneurship community to attract international investors. El-Abd noted that while the sector remains promising, it continues to face various challenges that the new initiatives aim to resolve.
The meeting also addressed a proposal for a unified government initiative to stimulate private sector and venture capital investment from both domestic and international sources to maximise returns from government resources. Attendees included Amr Talaat, Minister of Communications and Information Technology, Ayman Ashour, Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Mohamed Farid, Chairperson of the Financial Regulatory Authority, and Yasser Sobhi, Deputy Minister of Finance for Fiscal Policies.",457,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.7916203737258911,2026-01-10T09:22:40.875059
2026-01-05,Real GDP growth projected to reach 6.2% by FY 2029/30: Finance Ministry,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/05/real-gdp-growth-projected-to-reach-6-2-by-fy-2029-30-finance-ministry/,"Egypt’s real GDP growth is projected to reach around 5% in fiscal year (FY) 2025/2026 and 5.3% in FY 2026/2027, before accelerating to 6.2% by FY 2029/2030, according to the Ministry of Finance.
In its Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy covering FY 2026/2027 to FY 2029/2030, the ministry attributed this outlook to the continued expansion of the industrial production base, rising infrastructure investment, the resilience of the tourism sector amid regional and geopolitical challenges, and improved export competitiveness. These developments come against a backdrop of greater macroeconomic stability and the adoption of a flexible exchange rate regime aligned with global and regional economic conditions.
The ministry highlighted non-oil manufacturing as the primary engine of growth, with its contribution to GDP expected to rise significantly over the medium term. The sector recorded real growth of 13.4% in FY 2024/2025, supported by deeper localisation of manufacturing, the expansion of export support initiatives, and targeted incentives for high value-added industries. These measures include interest rate support for loans to productive sectors and dedicated programmes for priority industrial activities.
Tourism is also expected to sustain its strong performance, benefiting from relative regional stability, the launch of major national projects, and the expansion of hotel capacity across key destinations, including the Red Sea and the North Coast. The opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum is expected to further boost foreign currency inflows and employment. In parallel, the communications and information technology sector recorded growth of 14% in FY 2024/2025, driven by increased technological opportunities and the expansion of outsourcing services and digital exports.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Egyptian economy is set to continue its recovery and structural reform trajectory in FY 2026/2027 despite exceptional regional and global challenges. This momentum is expected to be supported by private investment, foreign direct investment, and stronger contributions from productive and export-oriented industries, alongside the continued implementation of the economic reform programme and progress in state exit plans and partnerships with the private sector.
Fiscal policy over FY 2026/2027 and the medium term aims to balance fiscal discipline with support for economic activity. The ministry said this will be achieved through measures that enhance investor confidence, strengthen productive sectors, and generate sustainable and productive employment opportunities.
Within this framework, the ministry is targeting a continued decline in budget-sector debt indicators, with the aim of reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio to below 70% by 2030. This objective will be pursued through the maintenance of annual primary surpluses, the development of budget revenues—particularly tax revenues—in a growth-supportive manner, and the anticipated easing of interest rates. Additional measures include the use of exceptional proceeds from the state exit programme to reduce debt, the implementation of debt-for-investment swap transactions, and further coordinated actions to reinforce debt sustainability.
The ministry also plans to strengthen budget-sector debt management by diversifying debt instruments and the investor base and extending debt maturities to reduce financing costs and risks. A medium-term debt management strategy will be issued to provide greater transparency regarding the government’s approach.
It noted that reducing debt levels and debt servicing costs remains a central medium-term priority. Budget-sector debt declined from around 96% of GDP in June 2023 to approximately 84% in June 2025, representing a reduction of about 12 percentage points in two years, while external debt of budget-sector entities fell by $4bn over the same period.
The ministry said it will maintain the pace of fiscal and structural reforms and aims to achieve a primary surplus of 4% of GDP in FY 2025/2026, while continuing to support economic growth and expand social spending and investment in human development. The gradual decline in interest rates, supported by easing inflation, is expected to contribute to a reduction in the overall budget deficit from 7.2% of GDP in FY 2024/2025 to around 4.9% in FY 2026/2027, within the framework of ongoing fiscal consolidation.
Achieving these targets will depend on increasing public revenues while keeping primary expenditure, excluding interest payments, under control as a share of GDP. The ministry aims to raise tax revenues by around 1% of GDP annually during the current and next fiscal years, bringing tax revenues to about 14.4% of GDP in FY 2026/2027 and further to approximately 15.2% by FY 2029/2030, a level close to the lower bound typically observed in emerging markets.
This will be supported by the continued implementation of tax reform and facilitation packages to broaden the tax base, with priority given to measures that have a limited impact on inflation. The Ministry of Finance is currently finalising a medium-term tax policy document to provide greater clarity and direction for tax policy.
Interest payments as a share of GDP are expected to decline as a result of tighter control over debt levels and lower interest rates in an environment of easing inflation.
The government will continue to prioritise spending on health, education, and social protection, while supporting key sectors to improve basic service provision and increase development spending, with the aim of delivering tangible improvements in service quality.
The ministry added that ongoing structural reforms, tax facilitations, investment-friendly policies, export support initiatives, sector-specific programmes, expanded public–private partnerships, and the utilisation of infrastructure developed in recent years are expected to raise growth to at least 5–6% over the medium term. This growth will be driven by private investment, non-oil export expansion, and the creation of employment opportunities capable of absorbing new labour market entrants, alongside continued progress in reducing inflation and a gradual decline in average interest rates on new treasury bill and bond issuances.
The Ministry of Finance issued its Public Finance Strategy on Sunday, which serves as the foundation for preparing the FY 2026/2027 budget and the medium-term budget framework. The strategy was issued in line with the Unified Public Finance Law No. 6 of 2022 and its amendments under Law No. 18 of 2024, which require the ministry to propose the state’s general fiscal policy directions through an annually updated strategy reflecting economic developments and national priorities.
The Public Finance Strategy complements other government economic reports outlining policy orientations and medium-term programmes and also serves as the preliminary financial statement for the state budget. Through this framework, the government aims to enhance economic performance, preserve stability and competitiveness, attract domestic and foreign private investment, and deliver tangible improvements in living standards.",1044,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9475975036621094,2026-01-10T09:22:52.341905
2026-01-08,International Consultant Mohamed El-Lethey Proposes 9 Comprehensive Strategies for Egypt to Navigate EU CBAM and Boost Export Competitiveness in 2026,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/08/international-consultant-mohamed-el-lethey-proposes-9-comprehensive-strategies-for-egypt-to-navigate-eu-cbam-and-boost-export-competitiveness-in-2026/,"The European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (
CBAM
) entered full enforcement on Thursday, placing carbon tariffs on Egypt’s major exports to the bloc—worth $14 billion in the 2024/25 fiscal year. According to
Mohamed El-Lethey
, International Consultant in Quality and Sustainability, these measures specifically target critical sectors including steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity, and hydrogen. Tariffs track EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) weekly prices of €85-100 per tonne of CO2 equivalent, demanding rigorous emissions monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) from Egyptian exporters to maintain market access.
El-Lethey noted that the mechanism—aimed at preventing carbon leakage—affects industries making up 33% of GDP that rely on natural gas for 81% of energy. “Without action, losses could hit $1.2-1.8 billion annually from 8-12% cost increases,” he told reporters, citing aluminium (78% EU-directed, $1.8 billion), cement (1.2 million tonnes a year as EU’s No. 2 supplier) and fertilisers ($4.5 billion last year toward $11 billion target).
Such pressures threaten jobs in production centres like Nag Hammadi, Helwan and 10th of Ramadan City, with ripple effects on supply chains, El-Lethey added. But he pointed to upsides: domestic carbon taxes creditable against CBAM could cut net costs 25%, while opening $3-5 billion green financing from World Bank ($700 million pledged) and EBRD, leveraging Benban solar park (1.8 GW) and Gulf of Suez wind farms.
El-Lethey outlined nine interconnected strategies—four government pillars supporting five industry tactics under MRV frameworks—for full 2026 compliance. “This creates a virtuous cycle of savings, resilience and leadership in MENA green exports, up 25% by 2030,” he said.
Government pillars
He called for immediate EU negotiations to extend transitional periods to 2028 and launch a national carbon market covering 50 million tonnes of emissions yearly, generating $800 million savings. A parallel $15 billion push would raise renewables to 42% of energy mix by 2030 via Suez expansions, reducing industrial emissions 25%.
Capacity building would train 10,000 engineers in MRV, with 35% tax incentives for 300 priority factories. A $2 billion sovereign green fund at 4% interest rates would mobilise FDI and public-private partnerships for retrofits.
Industry tactics
El-Lethey detailed rapid CCS rollout in cement and steel for 22% emissions cuts within 18 months, financed by green banks. Firms should shift to blue hydrogen from gas reserves, cutting costs 15% and enabling CBAM certificates.
Supply chain alliances with solar farms would shrink footprints 18%, he said, while diversifying 20% of exports to Asia and Africa via Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) and ISO 14067 certifications draws $2 billion FDI. Advanced digital MRV platforms would ensure real-time reporting, avoiding €100/tonne penalties.
“CBAM shifts from threat to opportunity when executed cohesively,” El-Lethey said. “Egypt can redefine its industry, protect livelihoods and lead the global green economy.”

2026-01-07,Five-year CDS fall to lowest level since 2020: Finance Ministry,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/07/five-year-cds-fall-to-lowest-level-since-2020-finance-ministry/,"The Ministry of Finance announced that Egypt’s five-year credit default swap (CDS) prices fell below 270 basis points on 6 January, marking their lowest level since 2020. At the same time, the cost and yields of international bonds declined sharply by between 300 and 400 basis points compared to the same period last year.
In a statement issued by its Media Observatory, the ministry said that both the debt stock and net borrowing ratios declined as a percentage of GDP, resulting in a continued reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio of budgetary entities during the first half of the current fiscal year, compared with the same period last year. This development coincided with a notable decline in risk indicators in international markets and among investors, reflecting an improved assessment of the Egyptian economy.
The statement came in response to a media report broadcast by a specialised Arab satellite channel on public debt, which the observatory described as unprofessional and inaccurate, warning that it could mislead non-specialist viewers.
The observatory explained that the report relied on a selective presentation of data that failed to reflect the full and accurate picture. It focused on the volume of new issuances of part of the domestic debt during the first half of the fiscal year, without referencing the size of amortisations and debt repayments during the same period. The report also overlooked other forms of debt, particularly external debt, creating the misleading impression that the debt stock increased by the full value of the issuances. The observatory stressed that such analysis is unsound, as changes in the debt stock are determined by net domestic and external borrowing, not by total issuances alone.
The observatory further noted that the first half of the current fiscal year recorded a strong increase in revenues of more than 30%, exceeding the growth rate of expenditures over the same period. Tax revenues rose by more than 32% year-on-year, generating a primary surplus of nearly EGP 383bn—equivalent to over 1.8% of GDP—compared with 1.3% in the same period of the previous fiscal year. This helped stabilise the overall budget deficit at 4.1% of GDP.
It added that the second half of the fiscal year traditionally delivers stronger fiscal performance than the first, as the tax filing season, higher tax inflows, and the transfer of surplus profits from public companies and government entities to the treasury typically occur between March and June.
The observatory concluded that the continued positive fiscal results confirm the budget’s ability to meet its targets for the current fiscal year, supported by solid and diversified economic performance, strong growth in private investment, and very strong performance in merchandise and services exports.",443,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9288306832313538,2026-01-10T09:23:12.104393
2026-01-07,Banking sector’s net foreign assets rise to $23.73bn in November 2025: CBE,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/07/banking-sectors-net-foreign-assets-rise-to-23-73bn-in-november-2025-cbe/,"The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) reported that the net foreign assets (NFA) of the Egyptian banking sector increased to approximately $23.732bn, equivalent to EGP 1.13trn, in November 2025. This compares with $22.656bn (around EGP 1.07trn) in October, representing a rise of about $1.1bn and a monthly growth rate of 5%.
The CBE noted that net foreign assets have maintained an upward trajectory for the sixth consecutive month. At the central bank level, NFAs rose by 1% to $11.88bn, while holdings at commercial banks increased by 9% for the third consecutive month to $11.85bn.
The CBE also reported that the total foreign assets of the banking sector, including the central bank and commercial banks, reached EGP 4.421trn in November, up from EGP 4.366trn in October. Meanwhile, total foreign liabilities stood at EGP 3.290trn, slightly lower than EGP 3.295trn recorded in the previous month.
Net foreign assets represent the difference between foreign currency assets, such as deposits and securities, held by the central bank and commercial banks, and their foreign currency liabilities. A positive NFA position indicates that the banking sector holds a surplus of foreign currency over its obligations, while a negative figure means that liabilities exceed assets.
Egypt’s banking sector slipped into negative net foreign assets in February 2022, amid a foreign currency shortage triggered by the Russia–Ukraine war and global inflationary pressures. The position remained negative until May 2024, when it returned to positive territory following the Ras El-Hekma deal.
Mohamed Abdel Aal
Banking expert Mohamed Abdel Aal attributed the recent increase in net foreign assets to stronger foreign currency inflows, particularly from remittances, exports, and tourism revenues. He stressed that sustained growth in NFAs is essential for maintaining confidence in banks’ ability to meet both domestic and international obligations, support corporate and retail clients, and sustain foreign investment inflows into government debt instruments. Abdel Aal also noted that continued foreign currency inflows contribute to strengthening the Egyptian pound against the US dollar.
Meanwhile, banking expert Shaimaa Wagih said that a positive net foreign asset position indicates that the banking sector holds a foreign currency surplus exceeding its liabilities, sending a strong signal of banks’ ability to meet market demand for foreign currency without pressure. This, she explained, boosts investor confidence in the country’s monetary stability.
The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE)
Wagih noted that the shift from negative net foreign assets in February 2022, caused by foreign currency shortages and the economy’s exposure to the Russia-Ukraine war and global inflationary shocks, to positive territory since May 2024, following the Ras El-Hekma deal, reflects the success of monetary and banking policies in restoring the sector’s international financial balance.
She added that higher net foreign assets support exchange rate stability by enabling the central bank to intervene flexibly in the foreign exchange market, helping to protect the Egyptian pound from sharp fluctuations. The surplus also enhances banks’ capacity to finance the real economy, including export- and investment-driven projects, while reducing reliance on costly external borrowing.
Shaimaa Wagih
According to Wagih, a growing net foreign asset position signals Egypt’s increased ability to meet international obligations, strengthens its attractiveness to foreign direct investment, and reinforces financial stability at the regional level. The presence of a foreign currency surplus also provides banks with greater liquidity management flexibility, helping to mitigate pressures during periods of economic volatility or unexpected shocks.
She stressed that the rise in net foreign assets is not merely a temporary improvement, but rather reflects the long-term impact of central bank and government financial policies. These include gradual regulation of the foreign exchange market, strengthening official reserves, enhancing the banking sector’s role in supporting exports and investment projects, and rebuilding both domestic and international confidence in Egypt’s ability to manage monetary challenges.
Wagih concluded that maintaining a balanced foreign currency position requires continued monitoring of inflows, directing surpluses towards productive sectors, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises and exports, and investing in safe financial instruments to maximise returns without compromising liquidity.
The increase in net foreign assets to $23.732bn in November 2025 is therefore not only a statistical improvement, but also a clear signal of foreign currency stability and the Egyptian economy’s recovery from previous crises. The surplus strengthens banks’ ability to finance the real economy, support exports, attract investment, and reinforce confidence in Egypt’s financial system, both domestically and internationally.",720,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8894987106323242,2026-01-10T09:23:36.640617
2026-01-05,Egypt’s FRA launches first digital payment network for non-banking financial sector,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/05/egypts-fra-launches-first-digital-payment-network-for-non-banking-financial-sector/,"The Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA) has launched the first integrated digital payment network for the non-banking financial sector as a central platform for the secure and unified digital settlement of financial dues.
The network, established through a strategic partnership with e-finance, is designed to facilitate interactions between entities operating in non-banking financial activities and the regulator’s oversight services. Mohamed Farid, Chairperson of the FRA, stated that the launch represents a practical application of “smart regulation” intended to accelerate workflows, reduce reliance on paper procedures, and enhance institutional performance through improved governance and transparency.
Under the new system, entities registered with the authority can register electronically, access immediate information regarding outstanding financial claims, and settle dues using approved electronic banking payment methods. The platform also allows users to track transaction histories and manage delegate accounts, which Farid noted would bolster investor confidence by providing a reliable and stable digital environment for the markets.
Farid emphasised that the initiative aligns with the Egyptian state’s strategy for comprehensive digital transformation, which is viewed as a primary pillar for supporting economic growth and improving the investment climate. He added that the digital network ensures data integrity and transaction accuracy while promoting a competitive economy based on technology and innovation.
The digital platform adheres to high cybersecurity and data protection standards, utilizing multi-factor verification mechanisms to ensure secure usage. To maintain service efficiency, the FRA is providing specialised technical support in collaboration with e-finance through a unified contact number. A one-month pilot operation phase for the platform commenced on Jan 1, 2026.

2026-01-08,The Cost of Roof Upgrades: A Comprehensive Financial Guide,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/08/the-cost-of-roof-upgrades-a-comprehensive-financial-guide/,"Let’s face it: thinking about your roof probably isn’t your favorite pastime. It’s just… there. Until it isn’t. Then, you’re suddenly lost in a maze of contractor lingo, bewildering material samples, and estimates that make you gulp.

It’s Never Just One Price
From Savings to Incentives
Explore Financing and “Free Money”
The Hidden Equation: Long-Term Value vs. Immediate Cost
Your Action Plan: A Step-by-Step Summary
But what if we shifted the perspective? This isn’t just about fixing a problem. It’s about making a smart, long-term investment in your biggest asset: your home. This guide is here to help you navigate that investment with clarity, looking beyond the initial price tag to the true value of safety, longevity, and simple peace of mind.
It’s Never Just One Price
If you ask a contractor, “How much does a new roof cost?” the only honest answer is, “It depends.” A host of factors conspires to create your final estimate. Ignoring them is like budgeting for a car without deciding between a compact and an SUV.
First, size and complexity are primary drivers. Roofers price by the “square,” a unit of 100 square feet. A simple, large, open roof will have a lower cost per square than a smaller roof dotted with chimneys, skylights, dormers, and steep pitches. These complexities require more labor, more time, and more specialized work.
Second, material choice is where costs can diverge dramatically. Here’s a quick breakdown of common residential options:
Material
Average cost per square
Expected lifespan
Key considerations
3-tab asphalt shingles
$350 – $550
15-25 years
Most economical, widely available, but basic in appearance and durability.
Architectural asphalt shingles
$450 – $900
25-30 years
Premium look with dimensional texture, better wind resistance, and superior warranty.
Metal roofing
$800 – $1,400
40-70 years
Excellent longevity, energy-efficient, great for snow, and higher upfront cost.
Wood shakes
$900 – $1,600
25-30 years
Stunning natural aesthetic, requires maintenance, not allowed in all fire zones.
Synthetic slate
$1,000 – $2,000
50+ years
Mimics slate beautifully without the extreme weight or cost, highly durable.
Clay/concrete tile
$1,000 – $2,500+
50-100 years
Extremely long-lasting, distinctive look, very heavy, requires reinforced framing.
Finally, don’t forget the unseen essentials. The tear-off and disposal of your old roof (often $150-$300 per square), decking repair (if rotted boards are discovered), and upgraded underlayment or ventilation systems all add to the bottom line. A low quote might exclude these, leading to stressful surprises mid-project.
From Savings to Incentives
Now that you grasp the variables, let’s talk strategy. Funding a roof upgrade requires looking at your entire financial picture.
Start with a Realistic Budget: Using the table above, you can ballpark your costs. For a typical 2,000 sq. ft. home (approx. 20 squares), a standard architectural shingle roof might range from $9,000 to $18,000. Always add a 10-15% contingency for those inevitable hidden issues. This isn’t pessimism; it’s prudence.
Seek Multiple Estimates: This is non-negotiable. Get at least three detailed, written estimates from licensed, insured, and well-reviewed local contractors. Compare them line-by-line, not just the total. What materials are specified? What’s the warranty on both materials and labor? A reputable pro won’t rush you or pressure you to sign on the spot.
In this initial discovery phase, leveraging technology can provide a powerful starting point. Before you even pick up the phone, using a resource like
eRoof’s free online roof quote tool
can demystify the early budgeting process. By inputting your home’s basic details, you can get a preliminary, data-driven estimate that helps you walk into conversations with contractors armed with knowledge, making you a more informed and confident consumer.
Explore Financing and “Free Money”
Cash: Paying upfront avoids interest, but ensure it doesn’t deplete your emergency fund.
Home Equity Loan/HELOC: Often the best option for major projects, offering lower interest rates and potential tax deductibility (consult a tax advisor).
Roofing Contractor Financing: Convenient but scrutinize the terms; APRs can be high.
Tax Credits and Rebates: Energy-efficient upgrades, like certain cool roofs or solar-integrated systems, may qualify for federal tax credits or local utility rebates. The Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE) is a fantastic resource.
The Hidden Equation: Long-Term Value vs. Immediate Cost
It’s tempting to choose the lowest bid. But the true cost of a roof is measured over decades, not just on installation day. Consider this long-term value equation:
Durability and Avoided Future Costs: That $12,000 metal roof might be double the cost of shingles upfront. But if it lasts 50 years versus 25, you’ve potentially avoided a second $10,000 replacement in 2050. That’s a net savings, not to mention decades without worry about leaks or failures.
Energy Efficiency: A roof significantly impacts your home’s thermal envelope. Light-colored “cool” roofs, proper ventilation, and insulated systems can reduce cooling costs by up to 15%. An energy audit can quantify this potential saving for your home.
Curb Appeal and Resale Value: A new roof is a powerful selling point. According to the National Association of Realtors, a full roof replacement recoups an average of 100% of its cost at resale. A worn roof, conversely, is a major red flag that can scare off buyers or lead to hefty price reductions.
Warranty Wisdom: A 50-year material warranty is only as good as the company backing it. Research manufacturers. More importantly, a contractor’s workmanship warranty (5-10 years is standard) is critical; it covers
leaks
from installation errors. The best materials are wasted by poor installation.
Your Action Plan: A Step-by-Step Summary
Self-Educate: Understand your roof’s basic size, shape, and current issues.
Get Preliminary Numbers: Use online tools and material guides to establish a realistic price range.
Research Contractors: Read reviews, check licenses and insurance, and ask for references.
Secure Detailed Estimates: Get 3+ in-person, written, itemized quotes.
Ask the Right Questions: “Are you hauling away old materials?” “Will you install ice and water shield?” “How will you protect my landscaping?”
Review Financing: Decide on your payment strategy and secure funds.
Get Everything in Writing: The final contract should include materials (brand, style, color), project timeline, payment schedule, cleanup details, and all warranty information.
Prepare Your Home: Move vehicles, secure patio furniture, and protect fragile items in the attic from vibration.
Think of a roof upgrade as the ultimate act of caring for your home. It’s a big commitment, for sure. But when you do your homework and hire true pros, you’re not just buying shingles; you’re buying decades of quiet confidence. You’re investing in cozy nights, dry attics, and the simple assurance that your shelter is solid. That’s the real return on investment.",1096,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.9309870004653932,2026-01-10T09:23:55.130435
2026-01-05,Turkish firm Eroglu Moda Tekstil to invest $5.6m in Egypt garment factory,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/05/turkish-firm-eroglu-moda-tekstil-to-invest-5-6m-in-egypt-garment-factory/,"Turkish company Eroglu Moda Tekstil has signed an agreement to establish a $5.6m (EGP 265m) ready-made garment factory in the West Qantara Industrial Zone, targeting the export of 95% of its annual production to global markets.
Waleid Gamal El-Dein, Chairperson of the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE), signed the contract at the authority’s headquarters in the New Administrative Capital with Suat Eroglu, the company’s chairman and owner. The project, which is entirely self-funded, will occupy 5,700 square metres and is designed to produce one million pieces of clothing, denim, and fabrics annually. Once fully operational, the facility is expected to generate 700 direct jobs.
Gamal El-Dein stated that the selection of the West Qantara Industrial Zone underscores the area’s competitive advantages, including its ready infrastructure, integrated supply chains, and proximity to Mediterranean and Red Sea ports. He noted that the project bolsters the presence of Turkish investment in the region and strengthens economic cooperation between Egypt and Turkey within the textile and garment sectors.
The total number of contracted projects in West Qantara has now reached 50, covering an area of approximately 3.46m square metres. These developments represent a total investment of roughly $1.352bn and are projected to create 70,365 direct employment opportunities. Gamal El-Dein confirmed that these figures include a collaboration with the Main Development Company (MDC), the SCZONE’s developmental arm, to establish ready-to-operate factories intended to support small and medium enterprises.
Eroglu Moda Tekstil is a manufacturer of denim and fabrics for international brands and employs sustainable production technologies. These include the recycling of industrial wastewater and the use of laser and ozone processes to reduce water consumption and chemical usage during manufacturing. The remaining 5% of the factory’s output is intended for the Egyptian domestic market.",289,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.5360041856765747,2026-01-10T09:24:40.648119
2026-01-07,Opinion | “The Grand Bargain” Between Trump and Netanyahu,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/07/opinion-the-grand-bargain-between-trump-and-netanyahu/,"Behind closed doors at the Mar-a-Lago resort, history appears to be rewritten through deals whose details remain undisclosed, yet whose reverberations are already echoing from the alleys of Gaza to the protest-filled streets of Tehran. The meeting between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu was far from a routine encounter; it marked the starting signal for a comprehensive re-engineering of the Middle East. At its core lies the convergence of Israel’s ambition to “neutralise” the Iranian nuclear threat and Trump’s desire to seal the Gaza file as his greatest political triumph.
Between massive F-15IA fighter jet deals, the re-emergence of monarchist chants in Iran, and the rise of Starlink as a new weapon in the hands of protesters, are we witnessing a replay of the 2003 Iraq scenario? Or does Tehran still hold a “last card” capable of setting the entire region ablaze?
In practical terms, the specifics of what was agreed upon at Mar-a-Lago between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remain unknown. Yet the outcomes are already taking shape. It appears that the meeting yielded a green light for Israel regarding Iran—its primary regional obsession, due to Tehran’s persistent pursuit of its first nuclear bomb—in exchange for Israel’s consent to implement the second phase of the Gaza agreement, which represents the pinnacle of Trump’s claimed victories.
The available indicators point clearly in this direction. Immediately after the meeting, Trump announced that mid-January would witness the declaration of the launch of the second phase of the Gaza agreement. On the ground, concrete steps have already begun to rebuild the Strip quietly, without public announcements or a clear contractual framework. The Qatar Fund for Development confirmed the resumption of operations at Hamad Hospital in northern Gaza, alongside the opening of a new branch in southern Gaza—despite Israel’s previous objections to Doha’s mediating role with Hamas. Even within the Israeli military establishment, statements by Defence Minister Yoav Gallant opposing the second phase prior to the disarmament of the resistance and the recovery of the last hostage’s body have largely subsided.
Prof. Hatem Sadek
On the other side, the stage was being set for a momentous development. Even before the Mar-a-Lago meeting concluded, the U.S. Department of Defense awarded Boeing an $8.6 billion contract to produce 25 F-15IA fighter jets for Israel, with an option for an additional 25 aircraft. The Pentagon noted that $840 million in Foreign Military Sales funds had been allocated to initiate the contract. Israeli military leaders had long sought this deal to preserve Israel’s air superiority in light of a potential Saudi F-35 acquisition.
Meanwhile, in Iran—the other party to this implicit bargain—the domestic arena appeared primed for upheaval. A crushing economic crisis, exacerbated by ongoing sanctions and intensified after the twelve-day war waged last year by Israel and the United States, combined with severe water shortages affecting Tehran and major cities following an unprecedented drought. The sharp devaluation of the national currency further compounded public hardship. These conditions ignited mass protests, the most intense in three years, initially led by merchants and later joined by university students. Government facilities were attacked, clashes with security forces erupted, and dozens were killed or injured.
Unlike the 2009 protests, when President Barack Obama refrained from intervention and adopted a neutral stance to avoid giving Tehran a pretext to label the demonstrations as foreign-backed, Trump stunned Iranians by issuing a direct and forceful message to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In a statement posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump declared: “If Iran violently fires on and kills peaceful protesters, as it has done in the past, the United States will intervene to help them.” He emphasised that U.S. forces were on full alert and ready for immediate action, concluding with a curt address to the public: “Thank you for your attention to this matter.”
Although such statements can be framed as blatant foreign interference—evoking Iran’s collective memory of the 1953 CIA-backed coup against Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh that restored the Shah—this historical precedent lends credibility to the regime’s accusations of U.S. and Israeli involvement in fomenting unrest. The narrative is not fabricated from thin air; it draws upon a deeply ingrained historical trauma that continues to resonate.
Yet what lies ahead may indeed mirror the past. Preparations appear to be underway for an alternative should the religious regime collapse under the weight of current events. As protesters poured into Iran’s streets this week, chanting in fury against the Supreme Leader and venting frustration over economic collapse, a slogan once deemed politically unspeakable resurfaced. Videos smuggled out of Iran showed demonstrators openly chanting in support of the Pahlavi dynasty—exiled since the fall of the last Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi—alongside calls to overthrow the Islamic Republic. For a system founded on dismantling the monarchy and erasing the Pahlavi legacy, such chants represent an existential threat, signalling that anger has transcended economic grievances and morphed into a rejection of the Islamic Republic itself.
For Israel, however, the dilemma is even more acute. Jerusalem would undoubtedly welcome a different regime in Tehran—one that does not funnel resources to Hezbollah, Hamas, and ballistic missiles aimed at Israeli cities. Yet direct Israeli involvement is fraught with danger. Netanyahu articulated this cautiously in a recent interview with Newsmax, stating that change in Iran “must come from within.”
As Tel Aviv argues, sanctions alone are insufficient to bring down the regime; they must be reinforced by technical support for protesters. This includes ensuring internet access through censorship-circumvention tools such as Psiphon and satellite communication systems like Starlink, enabling demonstrators to counter the regime’s ability to isolate them, coordinate repression, and control public narratives. Another strategy involves targeting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—not necessarily through military action, but via precision sanctions: naming provincial IRGC and Basij commanders who order live fire or mass arrests, freezing their overseas assets, and restricting their travel. The objective is to undermine the regime’s capacity for repression by raising the personal and institutional costs for those who execute it.
If this is indeed the path Israel intends to pursue, in coordination with the Trump administration, to engineer regime change in Iran, Tehran still retains one final card: igniting the region by launching missile attacks against Israel or U.S. targets at sea and on land, including in the Gulf. Such a scenario would plunge the region into a spectacle hauntingly reminiscent of the Iraq War.

2026-01-10,"Finance Minister targets higher spending on industry, exports and human development",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/10/finance-minister-targets-higher-spending-on-industry-exports-and-human-development/,"Ahmed Kouchouk, Minister of Finance, said the Egyptian economy is showing signs of improvement, affirming the ministry’s commitment to continuing fiscal facilitations without imposing additional burdens on investors or citizens. He stressed that fiscal policy will remain balanced and comprehensive, with a stronger focus on stimulating economic activity.
Speaking during a dialogue session at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, attended by experts, academics, university professors and students, Kouchouk said the new budget contains “a great deal of positive news” for the economy and citizens alike. He noted that any fiscal space generated from real economic activity would be channelled towards sectors that directly affect people’s lives.
“We are targeting increased allocations to support industrial and export activities, as well as human development, to drive both economic and social progress,” he said. He added that the ministry plans to expand funding for technical education, aiming to build strong partnerships with the private sector that support manufacturing, boost exports and provide a skilled workforce.
Kouchouk pointed to the rise in exports of information technology services from $500m to nearly $5bn as evidence of the capabilities and potential of Egyptian youth. He said the government is working intensively to develop state revenues by improving services, broadening the tax base and expanding the role of the private sector in economic activity.
The minister emphasised the government’s goal of creating a clearer and more stable business environment based on fair competition and effective incentives linked to tangible results. He described the “facilitations” initiative as an ongoing process aimed at expanding the economic, productive, tax and customs base.
Kouchouk said exports of goods and services are expected to become the main driver of growth and competitiveness in the Egyptian economy. “The more we produce and export, the more we can increase spending to improve citizens’ living conditions,” he noted. He added that domestic and foreign private sector investment rose by 73% during the previous fiscal year, reflecting strong confidence in the private sector, which the government continues to support to enhance competitiveness and growth.
He stressed that efforts are underway to strengthen trust and build a genuine partnership with the business community and citizens through maximum flexibility, simplification and facilitation.
Kouchouk said funding partners played a key role in the success of the facilitation initiative, which helped increase tax revenues by EGP 600bn, or 35%, without imposing new burdens. He noted that revenue authorities are leading the reform process, with continuous development aimed at delivering better services.
He added that the second package of tax facilitations focuses on providing further incentives and support to long-standing and committed partners. A mobile application for real estate transactions will be launched, while the tax rate will remain unchanged at 2.5% of the unit’s sale value for individuals, regardless of the number of transactions.
The minister also announced that value-added tax on medical devices will be reduced from 14% to 5% to encourage investment in the healthcare sector. He said the simplified and integrated tax system is designed to support small taxpayers with annual turnover of up to EGP 20m through unprecedented incentives.
Kouchouk affirmed that, backed by strong political will, the government is seeking a tangible and disciplined improvement in budget-sector debt indicators. He said ongoing dialogue on public debt reflects the importance of the issue, with proposals and ideas being taken seriously.
He noted that the budget-sector debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 96% to 84% over two years, compared with a 6.5% increase in emerging markets over the same period. External debt of budget-sector entities also fell by around $4bn during the same period, meaning more debt was repaid than borrowed.
Alexandria Governor Ahmed Khaled Hassan highlighted the positive momentum in fiscal policy, describing it as a powerful tool for economic growth. He said achieving a balance between fiscal discipline and stability, while stimulating economic activity, would be reflected in improved living standards for citizens.
He added that Egypt is steadily continuing its economic reform path through realistic policies aimed at strengthening business confidence, supported by successive packages of fiscal, tax and customs facilitations that bolster national industry and stimulate exports, enhancing overall competitiveness.
Ahmed Zayed, Director of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, praised the finance minister’s commitment to open economic dialogue based on a realistic, balanced and investment-friendly vision. He said the Bibliotheca serves as an interactive platform connecting decision-makers with citizens.
Zayed noted that the Egyptian economy has witnessed significant improvement over the past year, as widely acknowledged, adding that the tax facilitation initiative proved effective during the last fiscal year and contributed to restoring confidence in the Egyptian economy.",759,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8853470087051392,2026-01-11T09:23:35.379267
2026-01-10,The Egyptian Pound in 2026: A Delicate Balance between Support and Resistance,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/10/the-egyptian-pound-in-2026-a-delicate-balance-between-support-and-resistance/,"The outlook for the Egyptian pound in 2026 is shaped by a complex interplay of supportive forces and resistance factors, creating a landscape rich in opportunity but fraught with risk. Domestic dynamics—most notably monetary and fiscal policy—intersect with external influences such as global financial conditions, capital flows, and commodity price movements, making the pound’s trajectory highly sensitive to both local decisions and international developments.
The landmark monetary reform decisions announced by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) on 6 March 2024 represented a decisive turning point. These measures fundamentally restructured Egypt’s foreign exchange market, restored confidence in the national currency, and laid the foundations for relative exchange rate stability throughout 2025.
Supported by a firmly upheld flexible exchange rate regime and a set of improving macroeconomic indicators, the Egyptian pound regained ground against the US dollar, appreciating by 6.01% over the course of 2025. This followed a historic low in April 2025, when the dollar reached an unprecedented EGP 51.72.
As 2026 begins, the pound carries the weight of past challenges alongside the promise of emerging opportunities. It is therefore reasonable to describe the coming year as a “real test” of the currency’s resilience and the durability of recent policy gains. The central question is whether the pound can withstand existing and potential resistance pressures—and whether the available support factors will prove strong enough to prevail.
Any assessment of the pound’s future must begin with the support forces that have already materialised and show signs of sustainability.
Foremost among these is the return of Egyptians’ remittances from abroad to official banking channels, reflecting renewed confidence in the financial system following exchange rate unification. During the first ten months of 2025, remittances reached a record $33.9bn, providing a critical and stable source of foreign currency.
This has been complemented by expectations of a gradual recovery in tourism and a potential easing of regional tensions that have weighed heavily on Suez Canal revenues. At the same time, the strengthening of the banking sector’s net foreign assets has enhanced its capacity to meet foreign currency demand, reinforcing confidence in the pound. Net foreign assets rose to $20.783bn by the end of September 2025, reflecting a markedly stronger external position.
In parallel, foreign exchange reserves have continued to rise steadily, surpassing the $51bn threshold. This level provides the CBE with a powerful “shock absorber”, enabling it to manage market volatility with greater flexibility and without destabilising interventions.
Against these supportive factors stand a set of powerful resistance forces. The most pressing of these is Egypt’s external debt servicing schedule for 2026, widely regarded as the most demanding in recent years. Total repayments—principal and interest—are estimated at around $32.3bn, generating sustained demand for foreign currency whenever obligations fall due.
Such pressures increase the economy’s exposure to portfolio flows, or “hot money”. While these inflows can provide rapid liquidity, they also represent a structural vulnerability, given their tendency to exit swiftly during episodes of global or domestic turbulence—leaving the pound exposed to sudden swings.
This is where the importance of Egypt’s relationship with the International Monetary Fund becomes particularly clear. Engagement with the IMF extends beyond financing; it serves as a powerful signal of policy credibility to international investors. Any disruption to this relationship could sharply limit access to external financing and push sovereign risk premiums and debt insurance costs to critical levels.
A continued appreciation of the pound could yield tangible benefits, particularly in terms of price stability and improved purchasing power. However, excessive strength also carries risks, notably for tourism and exports, as higher costs in foreign currency terms could undermine competitiveness in external markets.
For this reason, the pound’s outlook should be assessed through multiple scenarios, each requiring tailored policy responses to manage risks and maximise potential gains in an uncertain global environment.
The first, and most likely, is the baseline scenario, under which the pound remains broadly stable within a range of EGP 46 to EGP 50 per dollar throughout 2026. This outcome assumes continued success in refinancing external obligations, steady inflows of foreign direct investment, a recovery in Suez Canal revenues, the disbursement of the fifth and sixth IMF review tranches, and the absence of major geopolitical escalations.
The optimistic scenario envisions a stronger recovery, with the pound appreciating to between EGP 44 and EGP 48 per dollar. Achieving this would require a decisive acceleration of the government’s privatisation programme, a full normalisation of canal revenues, a sharp decline in inflation, unwavering commitment to exchange rate flexibility, and sustained growth in traditional foreign currency-generating sectors.
By contrast, the risk scenario would materialise in the event of unexpected external shocks or a sudden reversal of portfolio inflows, potentially pushing the pound temporarily beyond EGP 55 per dollar.
Navigating 2026 successfully requires more than tactical liquidity or exchange rate management; it demands deeper economic restructuring. Sustainable currency stability ultimately depends on transforming liquidity into productive investment—particularly in manufacturing and export-oriented sectors—reducing import dependence, and creating genuine, long-term demand for the pound.
This process must be supported by extending debt maturities, continuing the shift from short-term to longer-term financing instruments, and reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio to ease fiscal pressures. It also requires a renewed focus on attracting foreign direct investment that builds productive capacity and creates jobs, rather than relying excessively on volatile portfolio flows.
Equally important is maintaining transparency and policy consistency, especially through a credible and flexible exchange rate regime that encourages investors to operate within the formal system.
The Egyptian pound enters 2026 with a rare and valuable opportunity to consolidate stability. Whether this opportunity is realised will depend on preserving flexibility as a guiding principle and moving decisively from a phase of shock absorption to one of comprehensive, productivity-driven growth.

2026-01-10,"Madbouly reviews progress of major healthcare projects in Cairo, Giza",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/10/madbouly-reviews-progress-of-major-healthcare-projects-in-cairo-giza/,"Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly on Tuesday conducted a field tour to inspect ongoing construction and redevelopment works at several public healthcare facilities in Cairo and Giza, reaffirming the government’s commitment to improving the quality and accessibility of medical services nationwide.
The tour comes as part of the government’s continuous monitoring of healthcare system performance and its broader efforts to modernise public hospitals, expand capacity, and ensure the provision of high-quality medical services to citizens.
During the visit, Madbouly inspected a number of major hospitals in Cairo, including Dar Al Salam Oncology Hospital (formerly Harmal Hospital), Bulaq Abu El-Ela General Hospital, and Nasser Institute Hospital. The tour also covered Om Al-Masryeen General Hospital and Bulaq El-Dakrour General Hospital in Giza.
The Prime Minister stressed that healthcare remains a top priority on the government’s agenda, in line with President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi’s directives to place citizens’ health at the centre of national development efforts. He highlighted the state’s ongoing push to expand healthcare initiatives across all governorates, particularly in underserved villages and rural areas.
“The government is exerting maximum efforts, in cooperation with the private sector, to secure the resources needed to improve healthcare services and ensure the financial and operational sustainability of new projects, while continuing to upgrade existing facilities,” Madbouly said.
He added that Egypt is advancing the implementation of the Universal Health Insurance System while preparing for its second phase, with the aim of ensuring comprehensive healthcare coverage for all citizens.
Madbouly noted that many of the hospitals currently undergoing redevelopment have been operating for decades without major upgrades. “These projects effectively amount to building new hospitals, increasing bed capacity and significantly enhancing the quality of medical and therapeutic services provided,” he said.
For his part, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health and Population Khaled Abdel Ghaffar said the Egyptian state has implemented extensive healthcare projects between 2014 and 2025, with total investments exceeding EGP 222bn. These investments covered more than 1,255 projects nationwide, contributing to the strengthening of healthcare infrastructure, the upgrading of hospitals, and the provision of state-of-the-art medical equipment.
Dar Al Salam Oncology Hospital
Madbouly began his tour at Dar Al Salam Oncology Hospital, where he reviewed service quality and followed up on the progress of development works. Officials explained that the project includes upgrading the existing hospital building, which has a capacity of 129 beds, as well as constructing a new building with an additional 108 beds.
The new facility comprises a basement, a ground floor, and nine repeated floors, bringing the total built-up area to more than 28,500 square metres.
Abdel Ghaffar highlighted the strategic partnership with France’s Gustave Roussy Institute—one of the world’s leading oncology centres—to manage and operate the hospital. Under the agreement, Dar Al Salam Hospital hosts a branch of Gustave Roussy, enabling the transfer of advanced cancer treatment protocols and international best practices to Egypt.
Since operations were handed over to Gustave Roussy on 1 June 2025, the hospital has recorded notable improvements. French consultants have reviewed 356 cases on site, while a further 27 cases were assessed via telemedicine. More than 90% of the hospital’s total capacity has been allocated to treating patients covered by state-funded treatment programmes and health insurance schemes.
Between June and November 2025, the hospital handled around 37,000 state-funded treatment cases, treated 580 insured patients, performed 100 bone marrow transplants, and recorded more than 50,500 outpatient visits. It also carried out 1,155 surgical procedures and delivered 13,583 chemotherapy sessions.
Efforts to reduce congestion and waiting times have included extending clinic operating hours, improving pharmacy services, and enhancing diagnostic efficiency to enable same-day chemotherapy treatment when possible. In addition, more than 65 training programmes were conducted to build staff capacity, with selected physicians nominated for advanced training at Gustave Roussy in France.
Direct engagement with patients
During an unannounced visit to the hospital’s existing building, Prime Minister Madbouly spoke directly with patients to assess service quality. Patients, including several women undergoing treatment, expressed satisfaction with the availability of doctors and medicines, and noted a clear improvement in service standards since the French management assumed operations.
Madbouly emphasised the importance of maintaining uninterrupted healthcare services during redevelopment works and reiterated the government’s commitment to accelerating project completion to ensure upgraded facilities are brought into operation as swiftly as possible.
He concluded that sustained investment in healthcare infrastructure remains a cornerstone of Egypt’s human development strategy, aimed at delivering high-quality and equitable medical care to all citizens.",740,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8223430514335632,2026-01-11T09:24:29.560014
2026-01-10,Egypt’s net international reserves rise by $4.3bn in 2025,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/10/egypts-net-international-reserves-rise-by-4-3bn-in-2025/,"Egypt’s net international reserves increased by approximately $4.343bn during 2025, reaching $51.452bn by the end of December, compared to $47.109bn at the end of December 2024, according to data released by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE).
Egypt’s foreign reserves comprise a diversified basket of major international currencies, including the US dollar, the euro, the British pound sterling, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan. These holdings are distributed based on exchange rate movements and currency stability in global markets, and are periodically adjusted in line with a strategy set by CBE officials.
The primary role of the Central Bank’s net international reserves—comprising gold and foreign currencies—is to secure essential imports, service external debt obligations, and provide a buffer against economic shocks under exceptional circumstances, particularly when foreign currency-generating sectors come under pressure.
CBE figures indicate that gold was the main driver behind the increase in reserves during 2025. The value of gold included in the reserves surged from $10.644bn in December 2024 to $18.166bn in December 2025, marking an increase of around $7.522bn.
This rise in gold holdings offset a decline in the value of foreign currencies within the reserves, which fell from $36.436bn in December 2024 to $33.232bn in December 2025, a decrease of $3.231bn. Meanwhile, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) included in the reserves rose to $56m in 2025, up from $31m at the end of 2024.
Indicator of financial safety and monetary stability
Banking expert Shaimaa Wagih said developments in Egypt’s net net international reserves reflect deeper structural shifts in the economy and its capacity to adapt to global changes. She described reserves as one of the most important indicators of financial safety and monetary stability, as well as a vital tool for crisis management and strengthening confidence in the national economy—particularly amid heightened volatility in global financial, energy and supply chain markets.
Wagih noted that the increase in net foreign reserves by December 2025 should not be seen merely as a numerical improvement, but rather as evidence of relative success in managing foreign currency inflows. These inflows stemmed both from traditional sources—such as tourism revenues and remittances from Egyptians abroad—and from more disciplined monetary and fiscal policies aimed at easing pressure on the local currency and improving the efficiency of foreign resource utilisation.
She added that the rise also reflects the CBE’s ability to strengthen Egypt’s external position without disrupting monetary balances, supporting exchange rate stability and containing currency volatility, particularly during periods of heightened demand for foreign currency.
Greater flexibility for monetary policy
According to Wagih, the diversified composition of Egypt’s foreign reserves signals a strategic approach to reducing risks associated with reliance on a single currency, while providing greater flexibility in responding to sudden global exchange rate fluctuations.
She explained that such diversification is not only intended to ensure stability, but also to enhance returns on foreign assets while maintaining high levels of liquidity and safety. Reallocating reserve components in line with global market trends reflects professional sovereign asset management and strengthens the state’s ability to absorb external shocks without resorting to severe corrective measures.
Wagih stressed that net international reserves are not merely a stockpile of currencies, but constitute the economy’s first line of defence in times of crisis. They play a critical role in securing strategic commodities, meeting external obligations, and sustaining economic activity during periods of slowdown or external shocks.
In emerging economies, she noted, reserves carry added significance as a key determinant of investor confidence and the assessment of international institutions, serving as a direct indicator of a country’s capacity to meet its short- and medium-term obligations.
Sustainability remains the key challenge
Despite the importance of the increase in reserves, Wagih cautioned that the main challenge lies in sustaining this improvement and linking it to genuine growth in foreign currency-generating sectors, rather than relying on temporary inflows. Strong reserves, she said, should reflect a productive economy capable of expanding exports, attracting investment, and achieving a current account surplus over the medium term.
She concluded that the rise in net net international reserves sends a positive signal regarding the resilience of Egypt’s monetary policy and the economy’s ability to withstand global volatility. However, it also places greater responsibility on policymakers to strengthen sustainable sources of foreign currency and translate this monetary improvement into tangible economic growth felt by citizens and the productive sector alike.
“Foreign reserves are not an end in themselves,” Wagih said, “but a means to ensure stability and pave the way for more balanced and inclusive development.”",749,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9389763474464417,2026-01-11T09:24:36.923074
2026-01-10,Annual urban inflation in Egypt stabilises at 12.3% in December 2025,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/10/annual-urban-inflation-in-egypt-stabilises-at-12-3-in-december-2025/,"The Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics (CAPMAS) announced that the annual inflation rate in Egypt’s urban areas stabilised at 12.3% in December 2025, unchanged from November.
Month-on-month inflation eased to 0.2% in December, down from 0.3% in the previous month, indicating a continued slowdown in price pressures.
In a statement issued on Saturday, CAPMAS said the consumer price index (CPI) for the country reached 264.2 points in December 2025, recording annual inflation of 10.3%, compared with 23.4% in December 2024.
Food prices lead disinflation
CAPMAS attributed the decline in annual inflation primarily to lower prices across several key expenditure groups. Meat and poultry prices fell by 1.1%, while dairy products, cheese and eggs declined by 1.2%. Fruit prices decreased by 1%, vegetables by 2%, and sugar and sugary foods by 0.1%.
Non-food items also recorded price declines, including household appliances (down 0.5%) and audio-visual, photographic and information-processing equipment (down 0.4%).
Selective price increases persist
At the same time, prices rose modestly in a number of categories. Cereals and bread increased by 0.1%, oils and fats by 0.3%, and coffee, tea and cocoa by 0.1%. Prices of mineral and carbonated water and natural juices rose by 0.1%, while tobacco prices increased by 0.2%.
Other increases were recorded in fabrics (1.6%), ready-made garments (0.4%), footwear (1.6%), housing maintenance and repair (0.5%), and electricity, gas and other fuels (1.6%). Household furnishings rose by 0.6%, glassware and household utensils by 1.0%, outpatient services by 1.0%, and private transport expenditure by 0.4%. Transport services increased by 0.1%, cultural and recreational services by 0.4%, newspapers, books and stationery by 0.1%, organised tourist trips by 1.5%, ready-made meals by 0.9%, and personal care by 0.9%.
CAPMAS noted that monthly inflation for the overall Republic rose by 0.1% in December 2025.
Monetary policy outlook
The inflation data comes after the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Egypt cut its key policy rates by 1% at its final meeting of 2025. The decision brought the overnight deposit rate to 20%, the overnight lending rate to 21%, and both the main operation rate and the credit and discount rate to 20.5%.
The MPC said the move reflected its assessment of inflation developments and the outlook since its previous meeting on 20 November. It added that Central Bank forecasts point to a continued decline in inflation during 2026, with rates approaching the official target by the fourth quarter of the year.
However, the committee cautioned that the pace of disinflation may be moderated by the slow easing of non-food inflation and the impact of ongoing fiscal consolidation measures, while global geopolitical tensions continue to pose upside risks.
The MPC reaffirmed its commitment to steering inflation towards its target of 7% ± 2% on average in the fourth quarter of 2026, stating that it would continue to calibrate the pace of monetary easing based on forecasts, risk assessments and incoming data.
The committee is scheduled to hold eight meetings in 2026 to review the outlook for key policy rates. The first meeting will take place on 12 February, followed by meetings on 2 April, 21 May, 9 July, 20 August, 24 September, 29 October, and 17 December.
The Central Bank cut interest rates by a cumulative 7.25% over five meetings in 2025, marking a clear shift from monetary tightening to monetary easing.",555,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.915131151676178,2026-01-11T09:25:06.170782
2026-01-10,Iran protests 2026: Military deploys as economic crisis grips Tehran,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/10/iran-protests-2026-military-deploys-as-economic-crisis-grips-tehran/,"The orange flicker of burning rubbish bins illuminated the debris-strewn streets of Saadat Abad on Friday night as thousands of people gathered in the cold. In the northern Tehran district, usually a bastion of the middle class, the air was thick with smoke and a chant that would have been unthinkable in previous decades: “Long live the Shah.”
Across the country, from the religious centre of Mashhad to the industrial hubs of Isfahan and Tabriz, similar scenes played out for a second consecutive night. Despite a tightening digital blackout and the looming presence of security forces, the protests—marked by the rhythmic thud of “Death to the Dictator” chants—have evolved from a local grievance over the price of bread into a nationwide challenge to the Islamic Republic’s nearly 50-year rule.
By Saturday morning, the Iranian military formally entered the fray. In a statement carried by semi-official news agencies, the army urged citizens to remain vigilant to “thwart the enemy’s plans,” vowing to protect strategic infrastructure and public property “under the command” of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. It is the clearest signal yet that the state is shifting from a police response to a military footing as it struggles to contain a crisis born of economic collapse.
The current wave of unrest began on 28 December, ignited by a strike among merchants in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar. Driven by a currency crisis that has sent inflation spiralling, the protest quickly resonated with a population of 90 million, many of whom can no longer afford basic staples. What started as a “bazaar protest” has now metastasised into a broader political rebellion, drawing in diverse social strata across cities like Karaj, Yazd, and Hamedan.
The Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reports that the violence has already claimed at least 65 lives, with more than 2,300 people arrested. The rising death toll has caught the attention of Washington, adding a dangerous layer of international tension to the domestic turmoil.
President Donald Trump, speaking from the White House on Friday, warned the Iranian leadership against using “excessive violence.” While ruling out ground troops, he suggested that any potential strike would hit the regime “hard in the place where it hurts.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed this on Saturday, posting on X that the United States “supports the brave Iranian people.”
Within Iran, the response has been a mix of defiance and admissions of failure. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, 86, dismissed the American threats, claiming Trump’s hands were “stained with Iranian blood” and accusing protesters of “destroying their own streets” to please Washington.
However, President Masoud Pezeshkian has struck a more sombre tone. “We are stuck, and stuck badly,” he told a cabinet meeting, according to Bloomberg, describing the situation as a “catastrophe” that has plagued his administration from day one. While Pezeshkian has urged security forces not to target “peaceful protesters,” his government’s primary solution—a monthly cash grant of $7 (roughly 9.8m EGP)—has been mocked as a drop in the ocean of 53% inflation.
The economic reality is stark: 20 million Iranian families have fallen into poverty over the last five years. In the month following Israeli strikes on Iran, the prices of rice and baby milk jumped by up to 30%. Mismanagement has also led to a water crisis and regular power cuts, despite Iran possessing some of the world’s largest oil and gas reserves.
This sense of systemic failure has revived the ghost of the Pahlavi dynasty. Reza Pahlavi, the 65-year-old son of the late Shah living in exile, made a rare and direct appeal on Friday, telling Khamenei to “leave this country” and live in Moscow. While analysts doubt a monarchist restoration is likely, the frequency of “Behlavi” chants in Tehran shopping malls suggests a profound nostalgia for the pre-1979 era, used by many as a linguistic weapon against the current system.
The state is now moving to sever the protesters’ ability to coordinate. By Friday night, the internet was almost entirely severed, and international calls were blocked. The Revolutionary Guard’s (IRGC) intelligence wing sent mass text messages to citizens, demanding they report “suspicious persons” and warning parents to keep their children indoors.
“Dandruff of the victims of recent terrorist incidents is on the necks of those who designed them,” the IRGC said in a statement via Tasnim, framing the unrest as a foreign-backed conspiracy involving Israel.
The immediate outlook remains grim. On state television, a presenter warned parents that the streets had become a line of fire: “If something happens, if someone is shot, do not complain.” It is a chilling coda to a week of fire and fury, as a government that admits it is “stuck” prepares to use the full weight of its military to hold a line that its economy can no longer support.",797,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.8047889471054077,2026-01-11T09:25:43.181839

The approvals follow recommendations from a specialised committee formed by ministerial decree to review applications for mineral exploration and exploitation licences. This forms part of the ministry’s ongoing efforts to regulate mining activities and maximise the economic value of Egypt’s mineral resources.
According to the ministry, the decisions include the issuance of 11 exploration licences for minerals such as vein feldspar, calcite, vermiculite, wadi feldspar, magnetite, iron oxide and talc.
In addition, 15 exploitation licences were issued for minerals including fluorite, iron oxide and phosphate, while 26 exploitation licences were renewed for phosphate, wadi feldspar, iron oxide, glass sand and vein feldspar. The approvals also included one land licensing request.
The ministry stressed that all decisions were taken in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations and are aligned with its strategy to promote investment in the mining sector and increase the added value of mineral resources.
Furthermore, the authority approved the issuance and renewal of valid licences for a total of 24 companies, including 18 private-sector firms and six public-sector and public business sector entities, in accordance with established regulatory frameworks.
The ministry noted that these measures support its broader vision of aligning mineral exploration and exploitation activities with the requirements of domestic industry, ensuring the availability of raw materials for strategic sectors. These include phosphate fertilisers (phosphate), glass manufacturing (glass sand), ceramics (feldspar), cement (iron oxide), and other downstream industries that rely on minerals such as talc, vermiculite and magnetite.
This approach is intended to support industrial localisation, strengthen integration between the mining and industrial sectors, and contribute to sustainable economic growth.",309,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.7336790561676025,2026-01-12T09:34:43.674710
2026-01-11,Madbouly says Egypt entering solar manufacturing era as $1.8bn energy agreements signed,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/11/madbouly-says-egypt-entering-solar-manufacturing-era-as-1-8bn-energy-agreements-signed/,"Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly on Sunday oversaw the signing of agreements and contracts for two integrated renewable energy projects worth more than $1.8bn, marking Egypt’s formal entry into the domestic production of solar energy components and battery storage systems.
The first project, developed by Norway’s Scatec, involves the construction of a massive solar power plant in Minya governorate named Energy Valley, or Valley of Sustainable Energy, supported by a battery energy storage system. The second project, developed by China’s Sungrow, entails the establishment of a factory in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE) to manufacture energy storage batteries. A portion of the factory’s output will be supplied to the Energy Valley project in Minya. Both projects are being implemented in cooperation with the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy and the General Authority for the SCZONE.
During the ceremony, Madbouly stated that the localisation of industries related to renewable energy is a fundamental pillar for enhancing energy security and achieving a green transition. He noted that attracting such high-quality investments reflects the confidence of international companies in the Egyptian investment climate. Egypt has entered the era of assembling and producing solar energy components, Madbouly said during a later television address, noting that new factories in the SCZONE have reached a local component rate of over 50 per cent. He added that this allows the state to meet its energy needs using Egyptian pounds rather than relying on foreign currency for imports.
The Energy Valley project is described as one of the world’s largest integrated clean energy ventures and the first in the region to provide stable, clean electricity 24 hours a day at a competitive tariff. It features a generation capacity of 1.7 GW AC from solar photovoltaic energy implemented entirely in Minya, supported by battery systems with a total capacity of 4 GWh. This storage capacity is distributed geographically between the governorates of Minya, Qena, and Alexandria to enhance the reliability and stability of the national electricity grid while reducing geographical bottlenecks. The project further includes the construction of new transformer stations and dedicated transmission lines to feed the Wadi Al-Saririya industrial zone in Minya.
The Sungrow factory, located within the TEDA-Egypt industrial developer zone in Sokhna, will be the first of its kind in the Middle East and Africa to produce Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). Spanning 50,000 square metres, the facility will create approximately 150 direct jobs and targets a full production capacity of 10 GWh annually. Production at the site is scheduled to commence in April 2027.
The signing ceremony was attended by Deputy Prime Minister for Industrial Development and Minister of Industry and Transport, Kamel al-Wazir, alongside Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy, Mahmoud Essmat, and Chairperson of the SCZONE, Walid Gamal El-Din. Norwegian Ambassador Erik Husum and Scatec CEO Terje Pilskog were also present. Key contractual milestones included a Power Purchase Agreement signed by Mouna Rizk of the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company and Mohamed Amer of Valley of Sustainable Energy. Additionally, land usufruct contracts were signed for both the Minya site and the Sokhna factory, the latter involving James Wu of Sungrow and Cao Hui of TEDA-Egypt. A direct supply order was also issued from Scatec to Sungrow for the necessary battery systems.
Following a tour of the Sokhna integrated industrial zone, Madbouly confirmed that 190 factories are now operational in the SCZONE, with another 150 under construction. He estimated that between 50 and 60 of these will be completed within 2026. These factories specialise in industries that did not exist in Egypt before, with 70 per cent of their production intended for export to provide foreign currency and 30 per cent covering domestic market needs. Walid Gamal El-Din highlighted that the Sungrow factory confirms the region’s readiness to host advanced technological projects within the rapidly growing Sokhna industrial area.
Minister of Electricity Mahmoud Essmat emphasised that the private sector is a key partner in these ventures, and the ministry is committed to providing necessary support to increase private domestic and foreign investment in clean energy. Madbouly concluded by stating that the Egyptian government projects economic growth to reach between 7.5 per cent and 8 per cent by 2030, provided the region avoids external shocks. He noted that the private sector’s share of total investment currently exceeds 65 per cent. To sustain this momentum and meet the daily demand for land from global manufacturers, the SCZONE requires an additional EGP 40bn in infrastructure investment for expansion areas.",744,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.6291412115097046,2026-01-12T09:34:48.709446
2026-01-11,Egypt’s real estate market enters 2026 with greater maturity after year of ‘repositioning’: arD,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/11/egypts-real-estate-market-enters-2026-with-greater-maturity-after-year-of-repositioning-ard/,"The Association of Real Estate Developers (arD) has released its first annual report reviewing the performance of Egypt’s real estate market in 2025 and outlining expectations and policy recommendations for 2026.
Based on insights from senior industry leaders and members of the association’s board, the report provides a comprehensive assessment of market dynamics, challenges and emerging opportunities.
According to the report, 2025 should not be viewed as a year of slowdown but rather as a period of “repositioning” for the real estate sector. Despite mounting pressures from rising construction costs and volatility in building material prices, the market demonstrated notable resilience—particularly in new urban communities across East and West Cairo.
These challenges triggered what arD described as a “natural filtration process”, differentiating financially solid, well-governed developers from those lacking clear risk management and operational discipline.
Looking ahead, the association expects 2026 to usher in a more mature and stable phase for the market, supported by improved economic visibility, the gradual return of investor confidence, and growing demand for integrated, mixed-use developments. Demand is also expected to rise for mid-priced housing units, alongside deeper and more structured partnerships between the state and the private sector.
The report highlighted several positive indicators. Mohamed El Bostany, Chairperson of arD, said 2025 witnessed clear market dynamism, driven by sustained demand for residential, commercial, administrative and hospitality units, particularly in Greater Cairo.
He added that the continued momentum in the tourism sector, especially with the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum, has acted as a key catalyst for investor interest and tourism-related real estate demand.
Large-scale investment deals, including Ras El-Hekma and Alam El-Roum, were cited as pivotal developments that have strengthened Egypt’s standing on the global real estate investment map and reinforced the concept of exporting Egyptian property. These mixed-use projects, the report noted, align closely with evolving market needs and enhance the international competitiveness of Egypt’s real estate offerings.
From a pricing perspective, Ahmed Amin Massoud, Vice Chairperson of arD, said residential unit prices rose by between 20% and 30% in 2025 compared with the end of 2024, particularly in New Cairo, the New Administrative Capital and coastal destinations. Total sales by major developers reached nearly EGP 290bn in the first quarter of 2025, marking a 23% year-on-year increase.
Rental yields also improved, averaging 6.7% nationwide, with higher returns recorded in fully serviced and well-developed areas.
For 2026, arD expects more moderate price growth of between 8% and 12%, alongside rising demand for small and mid-sized units and mixed-use developments. Developers are encouraged to diversify their offerings, better align products with the needs of the middle-income segment, and introduce longer and more flexible payment plans to address affordability challenges.
Regulation emerged as a central theme of the report. arD stressed that 2026 is likely to be a pivotal year for real estate legislation, with Parliament expected to issue a package of laws governing off-plan sales, safeguarding buyers’ funds, and enhancing transparency across the sector. The association views this legislative push as essential for stabilising the market and ensuring sustainable long-term growth.
The report concludes that Egypt’s real estate market is entering 2026 with greater maturity, stronger discipline and enhanced long-term potential, positioning the sector as a key pillar of the national economy and an increasingly attractive destination for both domestic and foreign investment.",550,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9385229349136353,2026-01-12T09:35:23.258444
2026-01-11,AradyMisr.com launches Egypt’s first end-to-end digital platform for land transactions,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/11/aradymisr-com-launches-egypts-first-end-to-end-digital-platform-for-land-transactions/,"Arady Misr for Planning and Development, a PropTech company specialising in land intelligence and digital real estate solutions, has officially launched AradyMisr.com, Egypt’s first fully integrated digital platform dedicated exclusively to the trading of land assets.
The launch represents a major step towards modernising one of Egypt’s most strategic economic sectors, introducing greater transparency, data intelligence and digital infrastructure to a market that has long been characterised by fragmentation and limited visibility.
Hamed El-Tahhan, Founder and Chairperson of Arady Misr for Planning and Development, said land remains one of the most valuable yet least transparent asset classes in emerging markets.
“Our vision for AradyMisr.com is to transform land into a transparent, data-driven investment that is easy to analyse, compare and trade, enabling smarter, faster and more secure decisions for investors, developers and landowners,” El-Tahhan said.
The platform leverages artificial intelligence, interactive mapping and geospatial analytics to digitise land listings and enable transparent buying, selling and leasing of land across Egypt. It provides users with verified land data, satellite imagery, smart contract capabilities and advanced analytics that assess each plot based on location, infrastructure, accessibility, surrounding services and optimal land-use potential.
By replacing informal assessments with structured, data-driven insights, AradyMisr.com allows market participants to move away from intuition-based decisions towards objective, investment-grade analysis.
A central feature of the platform is the Developers Room, a dedicated digital environment designed for institutional investors and real estate developers. The Developers Room aggregates land opportunities nationwide, including privately owned plots, government-affiliated land and assets held by major corporations and institutions.
“This feature functions as a centralised land marketplace—effectively a clearinghouse for land opportunities in Egypt,” El-Tahhan added. “It enables investors to assess opportunities of all sizes, from small plots to large-scale developments, within a single, unified digital ecosystem.”
Egypt’s land-trading market is estimated to be worth hundreds of billions of Egyptian pounds annually, spanning residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural land. A substantial share of transactions—particularly in agricultural land—continues to take place outside formal channels, underscoring the need for a centralised digital platform to enhance transparency, governance and market efficiency.
AradyMisr.com aims to position itself as the primary digital reference for land trading in Egypt and, over time, as a scalable model for land-market digitisation across the wider Middle East and other emerging markets, El-Tahhan concluded.",380,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.852626383304596,2026-01-12T09:35:51.440328
2026-01-11,Mortgage finance in Egypt accounts for just 0.3% of GDP: Qastali,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/11/mortgage-finance-in-egypt-accounts-for-just-0-3-of-gdp-qastali/,"Egypt’s mortgage finance sector remains severely underdeveloped, accounting for only 0.3% of gross domestic product, compared with around 41% in markets such as Morocco and South Africa and nearly 50% in the United States, according to Ihab Omar, Managing Director and CEO of Qastali Mortgage Finance.
In an interview with Daily News Egypt, Omar said the stark disparity underscores the vast untapped potential of Egypt’s real estate finance market and highlights the urgent need for legislative reforms and targeted incentives to revive mortgage lending activity.
He noted that existing regulatory constraints significantly limit mortgage finance companies’ ability to serve individual homebuyers, forcing many firms to redirect a substantial portion of their operations towards financing developers’ portfolios rather than end-user demand.
Omar explained that Qastali supports low-income clients by guiding them towards suitable financing programmes in cooperation with banks, particularly within state-led housing initiatives. The company prioritises ready-to-deliver units in order to minimise risks for all parties involved.
Financing challenges
Despite strong underlying demand, real estate developers continue to face major difficulties in securing financing, Omar said. Bank approval processes can take up to eight months, while mortgage finance companies are regulated under the same framework as consumer finance firms, despite fundamental differences between the two activities.
“Unlike consumer finance, mortgage lending is backed by fixed assets rather than consumable goods,” he explained.
Omar also pointed to the reliance on a single foreign credit rating agency to assess mortgage finance companies, with fees charged in U.S. dollars. As a result, only firms with portfolios exceeding EGP 1bn are able to absorb these costs, while small and mid-sized companies face financial pressures that may outweigh potential returns.
Ending the ‘developer as a bank’ model
Omar stressed that restoring discipline to the real estate market requires ending the practice of the “developer as a bank”. He called on developers to halt direct instalment sales and instead delegate financing and collection to banks and specialised financial institutions, ensuring proper governance of cash flows and preventing the commingling of project finances.
He outlined several risk-mitigation mechanisms for financing under-construction units, including the use of escrow accounts, whereby a portion of the financing portfolio is set aside as a reserve to address potential defaults. This mechanism, he said, acts as a safety valve for all stakeholders.
Omar also advocated activating irrevocable letters of guarantee (LGs) as a genuine test of developers’ financial strength, limiting reliance on paper sales or unrealised revenues.
Innovative solutions for distressed clients
Omar noted that distressed buyers—particularly those who purchased units years ago and are no longer able to meet delivery payments—often face contract termination, losses of up to 10% of unit value, and lengthy refund timelines.
To address this challenge, Qastali has introduced innovative solutions, including rescheduling instalments over 10 to 15 years instead of the typical four, significantly reducing monthly payments and giving clients a realistic opportunity to retain their units.
In a first for the Egyptian market, the company has also launched a “resale instalments” model, under which Qastali settles the client’s outstanding dues to the developer and then resells the unit to a new buyer through an instalment plan. The structure is designed to create a win-win outcome for all parties.
Omar cited an example in which a unit originally priced at EGP 6m, with EGP 2m already paid by the buyer, could be resold for EGP 8m. The original buyer recovers their down payment, while the remaining amount is paid by the new buyer in instalments, with Qastali managing risk and overseeing the transaction.
He concluded that such solutions help unlock stagnant inventory, stabilise the market, and prevent price collapses driven by individual defaults, reinforcing the resilience of Egypt’s real estate sector as a long-term investment destination.
Market outlook
Looking ahead, Omar expects property prices to rise by 15% to 20% in 2026, with potential increases reaching up to 40% by year-end, driven by higher construction costs, sustained demand, and improved financing mechanisms should the proposed reforms be implemented.",662,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.6296862959861755,2026-01-12T09:35:54.180161

The “Transforming the Livelihoods of Smallholder Farmers” project, a collaboration between the CBE, the banking sector, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP), aims to improve economic livelihoods through modern irrigation and financial literacy. The second phase, which began in January 2025 and runs through December 2026, targets 11 new villages following a first phase that the CBE says increased farmer revenues by 35%.
CBE Governor Hassan Abdalla and Minister of Agriculture Alaa Farouk conducted a field visit to Aswan villages, including Armana and Eniba, to review solar-powered irrigation stations and sugarcane seedling cultivation. Abdalla stated that the project aligns with the State’s strategy to support smallholder farmers and integrate them into the formal financial sector, while noting the initiative focuses on economic empowerment for women and rural communities facing climate challenges.
Data from the project’s first phase, which ran from January 2021 to June 2022, showed that 85,000 smallholder farmers benefited from the consolidation and development of 8,500 feddans. The introduction of modern techniques led to a 34% rise in crop production and a 37.5% reduction in operational costs, according to official figures provided during the visit.
Minister Alaa Farouk described smallholder farmers as the cornerstone of food security and a key pillar of the national prospect for the agricultural sector. He explained that the ministry provides technical and technological support, including modern advisory services and access to improved seeds, while the Executive Agency for the Comprehensive Development Projects (EACDP) acts as the executive arm to ensure support reaches intended beneficiaries. Farouk stressed that the financing offered by the banking sector is a vital source that sustains farmers and enables the purchase of production inputs.
WFP Country Director and Egypt Representative Rawad Halabi emphasised that the project marks a unique direct collaboration model under the auspices of the CBE. She pointed out that the model offers innovative tools through blended finance mechanisms and catalytic capital aimed at economically empowering farmers in line with Egypt’s Vision 2030.
The first phase supported the capacity building of 50 social and civil organisations and provided training for 2,250 candidates, where women accounted for 31% of participants. Financial literacy seminars reached 34,000 beneficiaries, and the project funded approximately 15,000 women to establish livestock projects, yielding a net income of up to 55%.
Participating banks also extended financial services such as the issuance of “Meeza” prepaid cards and mobile wallets, directing customers to Business Development Services Hubs affiliated with the “Nilepreneurs” Initiative. In 2025, the initiative supported approximately 23,500 beneficiaries and installed 21 solar power stations with a total capacity of nearly 1,000 kilowatts. This current phase has expanded to include the cultivation of strategic crops, sugarcane, and export-oriented cash crops such as cantaloupe. The visit concluded with a review of vocational training for women in upcycling palm waste and agri-processing, attended by Aswan Governor Ismail Kamal.",519,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8852996230125427,2026-01-12T09:36:12.332378

As Interim Syrian President Ahmed Al-Sharaa welcomed a high-level Egyptian economic delegation, the atmosphere shifted from diplomatic formality to the pragmatic reality of industry and regional trade.

Why This Matters Now
The “Invisible” $1bn trade path
A Blueprint for Reconstruction and Energy
Strategic Investment Sectors
The Future of the Axis
“The relationship between Syria and Egypt is not a luxury; it is a duty,” al-Sharaa told the assembled business leaders. It was a sentiment that echoed a bygone era of pan-Arab unity, now being repackaged for a 2026 economy hungry for investment, stability, and regional integration.
Why This Matters Now
The Syrian-Egyptian Economic Forum marks the first high-level mission of its kind since 2011, serving as a critical turning point for regional commerce. With the signing of two landmark memoranda of understanding (MoUs) between national Chambers of Commerce, Cairo and Damascus are formalising an economic bridge that has operated in the shadows for over a decade. This move signals Syria’s transition toward a private-sector-led recovery, targeting a formalised trade volume of $1bn as international banking barriers begin to lift.
The “Invisible” $1bn trade path
While formal diplomatic ties were frozen for years, the pulse of commerce between the two Mediterranean nations never truly stopped. Alaa Ezz, advisor to the Federation of Egyptian Chambers, revealed that despite the historical closure of the SWIFT international payment system, bilateral trade remained resilient through indirect routes.
“The volume of trade between Egypt and Syria is approximately $1bn,” Ezz told
Asharq
. Much of this has been moving through Jordan and Turkey, meaning the figures were often attributed to third nations. Ezz anticipates that throughout 2026, with the reopening of SWIFT and the formalisation of direct trade corridors, the true scale of this economic engine will finally be visible on official balance sheets.
A Blueprint for Reconstruction and Energy
For the Syrian leadership, the Egyptian economic model over the last decade under President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi serves as a template for rapid infrastructure development. President al-Shara’ specifically lauded Egypt’s strides in green hydrogen and renewable energy, describing the move as “far-sighted” and environmentally sound.
Syria’s emerging economic policy appears to be a mirror of this approach: moving away from state-dominated industry toward a private-sector-led recovery. “Syria has passed through multiple stages and is now ready for reconstruction,” al-Shara’ noted, acknowledging that while local expertise remains vast, the country requires “regional cooperation” to heal the structural damage of the last 15 years.
Strategic Investment Sectors
The synergy between the two nations is rooted in what Syrian Minister of Economy and Industry, Nidal al-Shaar, calls “natural integration.” The two countries share almost identical patterns of production, particularly in the textile and agricultural sectors.
Key areas for the new Egyptian-Syrian partnership include:
Infrastructure & Real Estate:
Companies like
Mena Real Estate Development
are already seeking clear investment laws to begin work on housing and urban projects.
Energy and Ports:
Modernising coastal infrastructure and gas exploration in the Mediterranean.
Agriculture:
A strategic priority to lower food costs by creating a regional supply chain involving Syria, Egypt, and Iraq.
Logistics:
Minister of Transport Yaarab Badr highlighted opportunities in phosphate transport and the potential for Syria to act as a land bridge connecting European markets to China.
The Future of the Axis
Ahmed El-Wakil, President of the Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce, underscored the human element of this rapprochement. “Syria and Egypt are one people,” he said, noting that the Egyptian private sector is prepared to transfer its expertise in infrastructure and industry to its northern neighbour.
As the forum concluded, President Al-Sharaa thanked the Egyptian people for their “warm welcome” of Syrian refugees over the past decade, suggesting that this “emotional investment” is the foundation for the multibillion-pound projects to come. As the two nations move further into 2026, the goal is clear: to ensure that the “natural extension” of their markets finally matches the rhetoric of their shared history.",685,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.6204483509063721,2026-01-13T09:32:24.551363
2026-01-13,EU to disburse €1bn to Egypt on Thursday under Macro-Financial Assistance mechanism,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/13/eu-to-disburse-e1bn-to-egypt-on-thursday-under-macro-financial-assistance-mechanism/,"Egypt is scheduled to receive a €1bn disbursement from the European Union this coming Thursday under the Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) budget support mechanism, according to Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation Rania Al-Mashat. The payment follows the government’s implementation of 16 economic and structural measures under the National Structural Reform Program designed to enhance macroeconomic stability.
Speaking at a joint press conference with European Investment Bank Vice President Gelsomina Vigliotti, Al-Mashat stated that Egypt is implementing more than 100 economic and structural policies designed to support the macroeconomy and improve the competitiveness of the Egyptian economy. The Minister noted that the new financing provides broader fiscal space for spending on social protection, health, and education, while concessional mechanisms help reduce short-term financial burdens and extend debt maturities. This development follows the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding for the second phase of the MFA mechanism worth €4bn during the Egyptian-European Summit in Brussels on 22 October 2025.
The upcoming payment represents the first tranche of the second phase of the MFA, which totals €5bn in overall support. A total of 38 reforms have been completed under the strategic partnership so far, including 22 measures linked to a €1bn tranche disbursed in January 2025 and the 16 measures completed for the current installment. Following this week’s payment, €3bn remains to be disbursed in two tranches during 2026. The 16 recent reforms involved coordination between the Central Bank of Egypt and various ministries, including Finance, Investment, and Electricity, to improve public financial management and facilitate investment licensing.
Recent fiscal reforms included strengthening domestic revenue mobilization and further activating amendments to the Public Finance Management Law to monitor financial information between economic authorities and the Ministry of Finance. The government also worked to foster the Medium-Term Budget Framework by adopting a formal coordination protocol between the Central Bank and relevant ministries to unify data-sharing and economic forecasting. These efforts built upon earlier progress, such as the 2024 implementation of an electronic payroll tax system and the establishment of an annual ceiling on general government debt.
To improve the business environment, the government implemented a competitive bidding system for the pricing and sale of industrial land to reduce the risk of violations. Additionally, the launch of an electronic platform for investment licenses aims to facilitate applications and attract more demand-driven foreign direct investment. These steps follow previous measures to increase transparency, including the 2024 publication of details regarding divestment and IPO transactions and the creation of a unified “negative list” of restrictions applied to foreign investment.
In terms of the green transition, the government issued a Prime Ministerial decision setting fees for groundwater extraction for non-agricultural purposes and adopted clear ministerial guidelines for drilling and operating wells. The Cabinet also approved a revised feed-in tariff for waste-to-energy projects and designated the entire marine ecosystem of the Red Sea as a protected area to ensure the sustainability of the tourism industry. To support energy efficiency, the mandate of the Cabinet’s Energy Planning Unit was formally expanded to include strategic planning.
Social protection measures have also been integrated into the reform program, with the government increasing the number of households under the Takaful and Karama cash transfer programs by 100,000 to reach 4.7 million beneficiaries by late 2024. Furthermore, the state expanded microfinance projects and launched the “Mehany 2030” electronic platform to develop youth skills and facilitate the transition from the informal to the formal sector. Al-Mashat emphasized that these reforms reflect the European Union’s confidence in Egypt’s national program and its support for the state’s efforts to boost financial stability.",597,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7737864255905151,2026-01-14T09:31:04.501920

Tarek Hussein, Chairman of Sky Ports, said during a press conference at the company’s headquarters that the project’s feasibility study took nearly two years, reflecting market challenges caused by a shortage of bulk cement storage silos meeting international standards. This shortage had previously constrained Egypt’s export capacity, despite surplus production.
He added that the project aligns with the government’s strategy to increase exports of finished products and strengthen the competitiveness of Egyptian goods abroad. Hussein highlighted that countries such as the United States have strict requirements for receiving bulk cement, which had previously limited Egyptian exports. The new terminal, he noted, will comply with international standards, opening these markets to Egyptian cement.
The project will feature eight concrete silos, each with a capacity of 20,000 tonnes, bringing total storage to 160,000 tonnes. Daily handling capacity will reach 20,000 tonnes, with an hourly capacity of 1,000 tonnes, enabling the terminal to accommodate Panamax-class vessels.
Hussein stated: “The Egyptian state is working to facilitate the export of local products and increase foreign currency revenues, with the private sector playing a pivotal role. The cement silos project at East Port Said supports this effort by opening new markets for Egyptian cement. At Sky Ports, we are proud to deliver this project in service of the national economy.”
The project is being implemented through international partnerships with Spain, Germany, and Denmark, ensuring compliance with the highest global standards so that Egyptian products meet international specifications.
Construction will begin with two silos providing a combined capacity of 40,000 tonnes, with technical systems currently being prepared in Denmark and Spain. Operations are scheduled to commence in January 2026. The remaining silos will be delivered progressively—two every four months—reaching full capacity by the end of 2027.
Once fully operational, the terminal is expected to increase Egypt’s cement export capacity to between 4 and 6 million tonnes annually, while opening markets that previously could not receive Egyptian cement.
In a related development, Sky Ports’ East Port Said terminal has been selected to represent Egypt in a programme promoting the transition to green ports across seven countries. The initiative aims to reduce carbon emissions and enhance environmental sustainability, in partnership with the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport and in support of Egypt’s Vision 2030 for sustainable development.
Sky Ports’ multi-purpose terminal, officially inaugurated by President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, has already achieved record operational performance, reducing vessel waiting times by four to five hours and achieving handling rates of 9.61 tonnes of cargo. These improvements have lowered export costs and strengthened the competitiveness of Egyptian products in global markets.",481,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8188676834106445,2026-01-14T09:31:39.859381
2026-01-13,Egypt is Africa’s largest recipient of private foreign investment for fifth year: Finance Minister,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/13/egypt-is-africas-largest-recipient-of-private-foreign-investment-for-fifth-year-finance-minister/,"Egypt has ranked as Africa’s largest recipient of private foreign investment for the fifth consecutive year, Finance Minister Ahmed Kouchouk said.
Speaking at a conference organised by the Egyptian–African Businessmen’s Association in cooperation with e-Tax, Kouchouk said the Egyptian economy has begun to gain strong momentum. He noted that private investment rose by 73% in the 2024/2025 fiscal year, while economic growth continued to improve, exports increased, inflation declined, foreign exchange reserves exceeded $50bn, and foreign direct investment strengthened.
He added that the past fiscal year recorded a strong primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP, stressing that achieving such rapid financial and economic performance would not have been possible without the confidence and strong response of both domestic and foreign private investors.
Kouchouk said international economic experiences vary widely, with each country adopting approaches suited to its own circumstances, needs and priorities. He stressed that economic and fiscal reforms must be based on a clear understanding of both internal and external challenges, as well as citizens’ priorities.
He added that Egypt is ready to share its experience and expertise with sister African countries to enhance the competitiveness of African economies for the benefit of their states and peoples.
The minister said sustainable resource development cannot be achieved without strong and sustained private sector-led economic activity, noting that expanding the economic, productive, export and tax bases creates the fiscal space needed to advance development efforts and reduce debt.
He also highlighted the importance of investing in human capital, describing it as more critical than any other form of investment. “People are the ones who shape the present and the future,” he said, adding that digitalisation alone is not sufficient unless it translates into improved services for businesses and citizens. He also stressed the importance of effective media communication and dialogue with taxpayers, investors and service beneficiaries.
At the same time, Kouchouk said the Egyptian Tax Authority is continuing to develop its operations and simplify procedures within a framework of trust, partnership and support for the business community. He noted that facilitation packages are designed to address challenges raised by taxpayers, improve services and enhance certainty.
According to the minister, the facilitation initiative has contributed to economic improvement and led to a roughly 35% increase in tax revenues without imposing additional burdens on the business community.
He added that the government remains committed to the same economic and fiscal path, noting that indicators from the first half of the current year support this direction. Economic growth reached 5.3% in the first quarter, private investment rose by 40%, and industrial output and exports also increased.
Kouchouk concluded by saying that Egypt’s economic image has improved in international markets, adding that the government is working with the Ministry of Investment to reduce customs clearance times and trade costs, while supporting local manufacturing.",468,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8577535152435303,2026-01-14T09:32:03.320430

The funding figures, cited from Africa: The Big Deal data during the sixth meeting of the Ministerial Group for Entrepreneurship, include equity investments and debt financing. Separate data from Magnitt for 2025 indicated that Egyptian startups secured approximately USD 304 million through 69 venture capital deals. The report also noted 12 merger and acquisition (M&A) deals, the highest number of exits recorded across Africa during the period.
Rania Al-Mashat, Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation, chaired the meeting to review government policies and a proposal to establish a new institutional entity to support the entrepreneurship ecosystem. The measures follow directives from Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly to enhance investment and innovation.
The Ministerial Group reviewed several tools ready for launch, including a unified definition for startups and a startup classification certificate intended to regulate access to government facilitation measures.
The proposed Startup Charter serves as an executive roadmap featuring more than 80 government actions designed to coordinate efforts and provide policy clarity for investors. Additionally, a Unified Government Guide for Startup Services and Licensing has been developed to facilitate access to more than 170 services provided by 35 government entities.
The government also plans to launch a Startup Ecosystem Observatory to analyse data and measure policy impact, alongside a Scale-Ups Support Program aimed at preparing high-growth companies for international markets and future listings.
“The government is moving forward with the launch of the first package of initiatives and policies supporting startups, within a comprehensive vision to transform Egypt into a regional hub for entrepreneurship and innovation,” Al-Mashat said.
The meeting was attended by the ministers of youth and sports, higher education and scientific research, supply and internal trade, and labour. Hassan El-Khatib, Minister of Investment and Foreign Trade, participated via videoconference. Representatives from the Central Bank of Egypt, the Financial Regulatory Authority, and the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency were also present.
Discussions addressed streamlining government procedures related to taxation, social insurance, and labour offices. Officials also reviewed plans to expand business incubators and accelerators, protect intellectual property, and increase startup participation in government projects.
The growth in M&A activity reflects increasing interest from local, regional, and international strategic investors, according to the data presented. The ministerial group stated its objective is to support a knowledge-based economy and create job opportunities by linking the entrepreneurship ecosystem with scientific research and industry needs.",429,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7470107674598694,2026-01-15T09:30:37.496534

The signing took place at an event in Cairo attended by Egypt’s Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation Rania Al-Mashat, EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti, and RMBV Managing Partner Ahmed Badreldin.
The fund aims to provide capital alongside managerial expertise to local enterprises operating in high-impact sectors, including consumer goods and services, healthcare, and education. It is expected to unlock new growth opportunities in Egypt, support regional expansion, and foster closer economic integration between Europe and Egypt.
RMBV North Africa Fund III is managed by RMBV, a regional investment firm with a strong track record in delivering sustainable growth. By supporting the expansion of local private sector companies, the fund seeks to promote innovation and competitiveness while strengthening trade and investment ties between European industries and Egypt.
Beyond capital mobilisation, the fund aligns with EIB Global’s mission to work closely with local investment firms capable of playing a catalytic role in domestic capital markets, while enhancing corporate governance, digitalisation and environmental standards.
“Given Egypt’s strategic importance in areas such as energy cooperation, migration and shared economic interests, it is a key counterpart for the European Union and central to EIB Global’s strategy,” said EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti. “In this context, private equity funds play a crucial role in supporting the private sector and fostering a win-win approach between the European Union and Egyptian private sector partners.”
Minister Al-Mashat said the agreement marks an important chapter in the strategic partnership between Egypt and the EIB, reflecting confidence in the Egyptian economy and reinforcing the state’s direction towards maximising the role of the private sector as a key development partner. She noted that cooperation between the EIB and RMBV North Africa Fund III supports regional investments and enhances shared growth and economic integration between Egypt and Europe.
For his part, Ahmed Badreldin said RMBV aims, through its portfolio, to foster a virtuous cycle of growth by strengthening local value chains while deepening commercial and industrial partnerships with European suppliers, technology providers and service companies.
The initiative complements the European Union’s Global Gateway and Team Europe efforts to deepen cooperation through sustainable investment, innovation and inclusive growth. It supports private sector expansion in areas that enhance economic resilience, create quality jobs and contribute to the EU’s broader neighbourhood strategy for regional stability.
In line with EIB Global’s inclusive investment approach, the RMBV North Africa Fund III will ensure that at least 30% of its portfolio directly contributes to advancing gender equality. This includes supporting women-led enterprises, promoting gender-responsive business practices and fostering inclusive employment opportunities across its target sectors, with the aim of driving equitable growth across Egypt and North Africa.",480,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8134613037109375,2026-01-15T09:30:54.914011
2026-01-14,Gaza governance: US to unveil Palestinian technocrat committee and Trump-led peace council,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/14/gaza-governance-us-to-unveil-palestinian-technocrat-committee-and-trump-led-peace-council/,"As the United States prepares to announce the transition to “Phase Two” of its Gaza peace plan this Wednesday, the focus of the conflict is shifting from the battlefield to the boardroom. In the meeting halls of Cairo, Palestinian factions are now reviewing a handpicked list of 15 technocrats set to form the National Committee for Administering Gaza (NCAG), a body tasked with the monumental challenge of governing a territory in ruins.
Contents
The Architecture of Governance
A Coalition in the Making
The Hurdles Ahead
A Twenty-Point Test
This move marks a pivotal moment in President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace initiative. By moving beyond the immediate ceasefire, Washington aims to establish a dual-layered leadership structure: a local Palestinian administration for daily services and an international “Peace Council” to oversee the billions of dollars required for reconstruction.
The transition, however, faces a fragile reality. While US officials view this as the opportune time for a shift toward “governance and reconstruction,” the plan must navigate a complex landscape of Israeli security concerns, funding gaps, and the delicate coordination of international leaders expected to gather at the World Economic Forum in Davos next week.
The Architecture of Governance
The proposed structure seeks to balance local autonomy with international oversight. The NCAG, likely to be led by former Palestinian Authority official
Ali Shaath
, will hold “day-to-day responsibility” for Gaza’s utilities, education, and civil services.
To ensure global accountability, the overarching Peace Council will be chaired by President Trump. According to US officials,
Nikolay Mladenov
, the former UN Middle East peace envoy, will be appointed as the High Representative. Mladenov will serve as the essential “link” between the Palestinian technocrats on the ground and the international power brokers in the Peace Council.
However, the rollout remains fluid. While US officials told the
Wall Street Journal
that the announcement of the 15-member committee is imminent, sources told the
Financial Times
that the formal unveiling of the full Peace Council may be delayed to ensure all diplomatic pieces are in place.
A Coalition in the Making
The international dimension of the plan is expected to crystallise next week in the Swiss Alps. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is reportedly prepared to join the Peace Council, with a first meeting anticipated on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, which runs from January 19 to 23.
“You take the most important leaders and the most important countries—that is the Peace Council,” Trump said on Sunday, outlining a vision where global powers provide “constant supervision and oversight” over a government of “qualified Palestinians and international experts.”
The White House has clarified that the Council’s primary mandate will be to “set the general framework and deal with the financing of Gaza’s redevelopment.” This includes the deployment of an “international stability force”—a move Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin expressed hope would be announced in the coming days alongside the Council’s formation.
The Hurdles Ahead
Despite the diplomatic momentum, the path to Phase Two is littered with what officials describe as Israeli “obstacles.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government remains resistant to a full military withdrawal and has raised significant concerns regarding the reconstruction process.
Funding also remains a critical sticking point. The sheer scale of the devastation requires a financial commitment that many nations are hesitant to make without ironclad guarantees of stability.
In Cairo, the stakes are visible. Hamas’s arrival, coordinated with mediators, is aimed at “accelerating the entry into the second phase,” according to a movement statement. Their presence underscores the complexity of the task: creating a technocratic administration that can function on the ground while the occupying forces begin a phased withdrawal.
A Twenty-Point Test
The US peace plan, which entered into force last October, is now facing its most rigorous test. Phase Two is not merely about maintaining a lull in fighting; it is an attempt to build a functioning state apparatus from the ground up while the ruins are still smouldering.
As the Davos summit approaches, the international community will be watching to see if the “Peace Council” can provide the political cover and financial muscle necessary to turn a 20-point document into a tangible reality for the people of Gaza.
“The preparations are underway,” Minister Shahin noted on Saturday, reflecting a cautious optimism that the new structure might finally offer a departure from the cycle of conflict. Whether the “National Committee” can exercise true authority, or if it will be hamstrung by the same geopolitical rifts that started the war, remains the central question of the coming weeks.",757,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.8580392003059387,2026-01-15T09:30:57.785043
2026-01-15,Grand Opening of Egypt’s First Semi-Automated Container Terminal – Red Sea Container Terminals in Sokhna,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/15/grand-opening-of-egypts-first-semi-automated-container-terminal-red-sea-container-terminals-in-sokhna/,"Red Sea Container Terminals (RSCT) today announced the official opening of Egypt’s first semi-automated container terminal, located at Sokhna Port on the Gulf of Suez. This new facility marks a significant milestone in Egypt’s maritime development, backed by a 30-year concession agreement with the Egyptian government, reinforcing Egypt’s attractiveness for international trade and investment.
Strategic Gateway at the Crossroads of Continents
Developed by a consortium compromising Hutchison Ports, CMA Terminals (a 100% subsidiary of CMA CGM Group) and COSCO SHIPPING Ports, RSCT serves as a vital gateway linking Asia, Africa, and Europe through the Suez Canal Economic Zone. Strategically located just a few kilometres from the southern entrance of Suez Canal, one of the world’s critical maritime junctures, the terminal is designed to facilitate international shipping and boost transport efficiency for Egyptian importers and exporters.
Operated by Hutchison Ports, RSCT is capable of handling the biggest container vessel afloat. It offers unparalleled access for global shipping lines and optimises trade flow between the East and the West. Integrated with Egypt’s expanding transport network, including direct highway and railway connections to major industrial zones, RSCT facilitates seamless cargo movement across regional and global markets, shortening transit times for imports, exports, and transshipments.
The Grand Opening Ceremony was attended by government officials, including Dr. Mostafa Madbouly, Prime Minister of the Arab Republic of Egypt; Mr. Kamel El-Wazir, Deputy Prime Minister for Industrial Development and Minister of Transport, Trade and Industry; Mr. Walid Gamal Eldin, Chairman of the Suez Canal Economic Zone, together with representatives from shipping lines and industry stakeholders. Guests toured the cutting-edge terminal facilities, witnessing how advanced cargo handling systems set new benchmarks for port operations in Egypt.
During the visit, the distinguished guests expressed satisfaction with the progress and successful completion of the Red Sea Container Terminals project, noting that the launch reflects Egypt’s firm commitment to developing world-class port infrastructure. They highlighted the terminal’s strategic importance in enhancing the competitiveness of the Sokhna Port, supporting industrial and trade growth, creating skilled employment opportunities, and advancing Egypt’s Vision 2030 to position the country as a global logistics and maritime hub.
Mr. Clemence Cheng, Managing Director, Europe, Hutchison Ports
, said “The inauguration of Red Sea Container Terminals represents a historic milestone that reflects our profound commitment to Egypt. With an investment exceeding USD 1.8 billion in the country, we recognise Egypt as a pivotal market at the intersection of key global trade routes. Our partnership with the Egyptian government, CMA CGM, and COSCO SHIPPING at RSCT underscores our shared vision for innovation, sustainability, and excellence in logistics.”
Ms. Christine Cabau, Executive Vice President Assets, CMA CGM
, stated “As a successful joint-venture between Hutchison Ports, CMA CGM and COSCO SHIPPING, this new terminal in Sokhna combines world-class automated infrastructure with unrivalled North / South rail connectivity between Sokhna, 6th of October in Cairo area and Alexandria. Built for scale and speed, it offers Egyptian exporters and importers a powerful gateway to all global markets, boosting productivity and competitiveness.”
Mr. Zhu Tao, Chairman, COSCO SHIPPING Ports
, expressed “At COSCO SHIPPING Ports, we are dedicated to making our global port network better, stronger and more efficient. The grand opening of the Red Sea Container Terminals is marked as an essential pathway for trade, enabling seamless goods movement and strengthening ties between Egypt, China, and the broader global market. I am filled with optimism as we embark on this journey of cooperation and prosperity together.”
A New Benchmark for Port Technology and Sustainability
RSCT establishes a new era of smart and green port operations for Egypt. Situated within the world’s deepest man-made port basin, recognised by Guinness World Records, the terminal features Phase I infrastructure that includes a 1,200-metre berth, a water depth of 18 metres, and an initial handling capacity of 1.7 million TEUs, with plans to expand this to 3.5 million TEUs across 2.6 kilometres of quay.
Equipped with an initial batch of six remote control ship-to-shore cranes and 18 automated rubber-tyred gantry cranes – the first of their kind in Egypt – Red Sea Container Terminals leverages a proprietary Terminal Operating System, nGen for precise and real-time container tracking. The integration of auto-gate operations and data-driven practices enhances efficiency, safety, and the working environment for employees. In alignment with Hutchison Ports’ global sustainability strategy, RSCT employs fully electric-powered cargo handling equipment, including e-trucks and e-reach stackers, significantly reducing carbon emissions.
With a long-standing commitment to innovation and economic growth, Red Sea Container Terminals is positioned to play a crucial role in advancing trade diversification and fostering deeper international cooperation. The development of RSCT epitomises the enduring economic ties between Egypt and its global partners, paving the way for enhanced global trade opportunities.",784,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8576943278312683,2026-01-16T09:31:18.384411

The announcement followed the disbursement of a €1bn tranche in January 2026 under the European Union’s Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) programme.5 During a meeting with EU Ambassador Angelina Eichhorst, Al-Mashat confirmed that the ministry is currently coordinating with national authorities to implement reforms required for the second and third tranches of the programme, which are scheduled for disbursement later in 2026.
Al-Mashat stated that the 109 policy measures and procedures implemented under the MFA mechanism are a “central part of the national structural reform programme.” She described the recent funding as “international testimony of confidence” in the structural reforms implemented by the state and a reflection of the strategic relationship between Egypt and the EU.
The minister noted that the growth rate reflects increased contributions from productive sectors, led by industry, telecommunications, information technology, and tourism. She added that indicators for private investment and exports have also improved, which she said demonstrates the success of policies aimed at achieving sustainable and inclusive growth while enhancing the economy’s resilience against regional and international shocks.
The discussions with Eichhorst focused on the economic pillar of the Egypt-EU strategic and comprehensive partnership, including development grant priorities for the 2026-2027 period. The two officials also discussed expanding innovative and mixed financing mechanisms for both domestic and foreign private sectors.
Al-Mashat reviewed the “National Narrative for Comprehensive Development,” which serves as the framework for the state’s efforts to promote sustainable growth through human development investment, structural reforms, and the increased role of the private sector. The framework also aims to improve the efficiency of public investment and link planning with financing and monitoring.
Al-Mashat concluded the meeting by stating the government’s intent to build on current results to support sustainable development and mutual confidence in the path of economic reform.",319,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.829501211643219,2026-01-18T09:25:23.723511
2026-01-17,CBE steadily navigates economic challenges through sustained policy efforts: Abdalla,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/17/cbe-steadily-navigates-economic-challenges-through-sustained-policy-efforts-abdalla/,"Hassan Abdalla, Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), said the bank has steadily navigated economic challenges through sustained and disciplined policy efforts.
In the CBE’s annual report, Abdalla noted that, at the domestic level, the bank has remained focused on achieving the ultimate objective of monetary policy—price stability. In this context, the decisions taken by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) during its meetings in FY 2023/2024 were fully aligned with inflation developments and forecasts of inflationary pressures.
He pointed out that risks continue to surround the expected inflation path, including the escalation of geopolitical tensions, unfavourable climatic conditions both domestically and globally, as well as the impact of fiscal consolidation measures.
Globally, the financial system witnessed improvement during FY 2023/2024, driven by rising expectations that central banks in major economies would begin cutting key interest rates in the second half of 2024 as inflationary pressures gradually subsided.
Despite widespread monetary tightening to counter inflation, the global economy demonstrated notable resilience. Preliminary estimates indicate that average global growth rose to 2.9% during FY 2023/2024, compared with 2.7% in the previous fiscal year.
Most central banks in advanced economies continued tightening their monetary policies, led by the US Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates by 25 basis points to their highest level in more than 23 years. The European Central Bank also increased interest rates across its main refinancing operations, marginal lending facility and overnight deposit facility to record highs, before cutting them again by 25 basis points in June 2024 for the first time in nearly five years. Similarly, the Bank of England raised its key interest rate to its highest level in 15 years.
Monetary policy trajectories in major emerging economies, however, diverged during the period. The People’s Bank of China continued to cut interest rates, while the Central Bank of Brazil began easing its policy stance. In contrast, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation shifted towards rapid rate hikes, and the Central Bank of Turkey continued raising rates several times to curb sharply rising inflation. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India and the South African Reserve Bank maintained interest rates at elevated levels.
Following the end of the fiscal year under review, the US Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate for the first time since 2020, reducing it by a cumulative 75 basis points in September and November 2024 to stimulate growth and support the labour market. The European Central Bank also continued to lower its key rates in September and October, while the Bank of England reduced its policy rate twice, in August and November 2024. Conversely, the Bank of Japan continued to raise the interest rate on excess reserves held by financial institutions in July 2024, reaching its highest level since the global financial crisis of 2008.
Against this backdrop, Abdalla stressed that the MPC would not hesitate to deploy all available tools to maintain tight monetary conditions, with the aim of sustainably reducing monthly inflation rates and achieving price stability over the medium term.
Accordingly, the CBE adopted a tightening monetary stance through seven MPC meetings during FY 2023/2024, resulting in a cumulative increase of 900 basis points in key policy rates.
At an extraordinary MPC meeting held on 6 March 2024, the CBE announced that it would allow the exchange rate to be determined by market forces. This move facilitated the elimination of foreign exchange backlogs following the closure of the gap between official and parallel market rates.
As a result, Egypt’s external position witnessed a marked improvement, supported by unprecedented inflows of foreign direct investment and portfolio investments. The decision also contributed to higher remittances from Egyptians working abroad, increased proceeds from non-oil merchandise exports, and stronger tourism revenues. Together, these developments helped rebuild the CBE’s foreign exchange reserves and strengthen banks’ external positions.
Abdalla said the crises and challenges faced globally over the past two years have underscored the resilience of the Egyptian banking system and the CBE’s capacity to support the national economy while fulfilling its core mandate of maintaining monetary and banking stability.
During FY 2023/2024, the aggregate financial position of banks—excluding the CBE—expanded by 40.1%, while key financial soundness indicators remained robust. The capital adequacy ratio, including the capital conservation buffer, reached 18.6% at the end of June 2024, well above the minimum requirement of 12.5%. The financial leverage ratio stood at 7.5%, compared with a mandatory minimum of 3%.
Returns on average assets and equity registered 2.0% and 32.2%, respectively, based on approved FY 2023 figures. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans and facilities stood at 2.7% in June 2024, with provisions covering 86.2% of non-performing exposures.
Within the framework of strengthening the legislative and regulatory environment and implementing the Central Bank and Banking Sector Law No. 194 of 2020—designed to align with international best practices—the CBE issued several prudential regulations, including a comprehensive licensing and regulatory framework for digital banks. It also extended its directive requiring banks to allocate 25% of their credit facilities portfolio to financing micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).
The CBE, Abdalla noted, remains firmly committed to its leading role in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals and the objectives of Egypt’s Vision 2030. As a result of its financial inclusion initiatives, the inclusion rate rose to 71.5% of the population in June 2024, representing 48.1 million citizens aged 16 and above with active bank accounts.
In parallel, efforts to strengthen digital financial infrastructure led to a sharp increase in the value of instant transfer transactions executed through the Instant Payments Network (IPN), launched in March 2022, reaching approximately EGP 1.8trn in June 2024.
“Lastly, I would like to express my profound confidence in the CBE’s ability to overcome all challenges, supported by its forward-thinking cadres and diverse institutional capabilities,” Abdalla said.
“I also extend my sincere appreciation to all employees of the Central Bank of Egypt for their dedication and hard work. I look forward to continuing our efforts, driven by teamwork and cooperation, to achieve a distinguished position that sets an example for central banks at both regional and international levels.”",1014,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.835452675819397,2026-01-18T09:26:18.396986
2026-01-17,157 investment projects across public sector companies: Minister,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/17/157-investment-projects-across-public-sector-companies-minister/,"Mohamed El-Shimy, Minister of the Public Enterprises Sector, said Egypt is moving steadily towards building a strong, competitive, and sustainable economy anchored in industry, production, exports, and investment, with young people placed at the heart of the development process as a cornerstone of the “New Republic” and the true architects of its future.
El-Shimy explained that the “New Republic”, whose foundations were laid by President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, represents a new way of thinking and an integrated vision centred on building human capital, maximising the value of work, optimising the use of state resources, enhancing asset efficiency, and achieving comprehensive and sustainable development. This vision also focuses on industrial localisation and strengthening the competitiveness of the Egyptian economy.
Speaking during his participation in the Akhbar Al-Youm Economic Conference, the minister stressed that the Public Enterprises Sector is a key pillar of the national economy, given its extensive industrial legacy, substantial assets, accumulated expertise, and a qualified workforce and technical base capable of acting as a real engine for industrial and export-led growth.
He noted that the ministry oversees six holding companies operating in strategic sectors, including metallurgy, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, textiles, tourism and hotels, and construction and development. These holding companies supervise 63 affiliated companies, in addition to equity participation in 106 joint ventures, reflecting both the scale of responsibility and the significant opportunities for growth, development, and maximising economic returns.
El-Shimy said the ministry’s strategy is driven by a core objective: achieving the highest possible return on state investments in Public Enterprises Sector companies, increasing their contribution to national output, enhancing their competitiveness locally and internationally, and transforming them into sustainable, growth-oriented economic entities.
He added that this strategy is being implemented through several key pillars, including improving company performance, modernising management and operational methods in line with global best practices, strengthening private sector participation as a key partner for technology and expertise transfer, adhering to international standards for quality, sustainability, occupational safety, and health, and upgrading human capital through continuous training, capacity building, and skills development.
The minister revealed that companies affiliated with the ministry are currently implementing around 157 investment projects across various sectors, with total investments estimated at approximately EGP 184bn, as part of efforts to rebuild and modernise the industrial and service base of Public Enterprises Sector companies. He added that about EGP 32bn has been allocated to environmental and energy projects, including green hydrogen production, renewable energy, energy efficiency improvements, the application of circular economy concepts, and carbon emissions reduction.
These initiatives, he said, are aligned with international environmental standards, support compliance with the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), and enhance the access of Egyptian products to global markets.
On financial performance, El-Shimy confirmed that affiliated companies achieved strong results during the 2024–2025 fiscal year, with total revenues reaching approximately EGP 126bn, marking growth of nearly 20% year-on-year. Net profits amounted to around EGP 24bn, reflecting improved operational efficiency and the success of ongoing development programmes.
In terms of exports, he said total exports by affiliated companies reached approximately $1bn in FY 2024/25, recording growth of 27%. Around 40% of the ministry’s companies export their products to a wide range of markets across Arab countries, Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas, underscoring improvements in product quality and international competitiveness.
El-Shimy also praised the role of the Ministerial Committee for Industrial Development, chaired by Kamel El-Wazir, describing it as a successful model of inter-ministerial coordination that helps address industrial challenges, accelerate project implementation, and unify policies supporting production and industrial localisation.
He highlighted several major projects currently under way to deepen industrial capacity and boost exports, including the national project to develop the spinning and weaving industry across seven companies nationwide, the development of fertiliser production at affiliated companies, the upgrading of pharmaceutical production lines in line with global Good Manufacturing Practice standards, the localisation of active pharmaceutical ingredients and biological products, and major expansion projects at Egypt Aluminium Company.
The minister reviewed a number of notable success stories involving the revival of idle assets and the restart of factories that had been out of operation for years. These include the return of El Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company to production under a modern industrial vision; the reopening of the Egyptian Carbon Anode Blocks Company to support the aluminium industry and exports; the revival of El Nasr Pharmaceutical Chemicals Company; the restart of the ferrosilicon plant at KIMA in Aswan; and the rehabilitation of historic and tourism assets such as the Continental Hotel in Cairo, the Cotton Palace in Alexandria, and the Granada Palace.
El-Shimy affirmed that the Public Enterprises Sector offers promising investment opportunities across industry, energy, tourism, real estate development, and logistics services. He pointed to successful partnership models with local and foreign private sector entities that have attracted new investments, facilitated technology transfer, improved operational efficiency, and created sustainable job opportunities, stressing the ministry’s openness to expanding such partnerships.
In closing, El-Shimy reaffirmed that the youth of the New Republic are the primary partners in the development journey and the drivers of Egypt’s industrial and economic future. He expressed his appreciation to Akhbar Al-Youm for organising the conference and thanked all participants, expressing his hope for Egypt to remain strong through its industry, competitive through its exports, attractive through its investments, and driven by the hands and minds of its people.",888,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.5470574498176575,2026-01-18T09:27:06.623434
2026-01-17,Non-food prices continue to drive headline inflation as food inflation returns to pre-2022 levels: CBE,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/17/non-food-prices-continue-to-drive-headline-inflation-as-food-inflation-returns-to-pre-2022-levels-cbe/,"Annual urban headline inflation remained stable at around 12.3% in December 2025, virtually unchanged from November, according to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). The annual dynamics of headline inflation continue to be driven primarily by non-food prices, as food inflation has fallen back to its pre-2022 levels.
Annual food inflation declined sharply to 1.5% in December 2025, down from 20.3% in December 2024, although it rose slightly from 0.7% in November 2025. The impact of this increase was limited, as annual non-food inflation eased to 19.5% in December 2025 from 20.2% in November and 26.7% a year earlier.
Annual core inflation declined to 11.8% in December 2025 from 12.5% in November, driven by weaker contributions from core food, retail and services. Monthly core inflation also decelerated to 0.2% in December, compared with 0.8% in November and 0.9% in December 2024, reflecting mainly negative core food inflation.
Monthly urban headline inflation stood at 0.2% in December 2025, broadly unchanged from 0.3% in November and matching the rate recorded in December 2024. This stability reflects broad-based price declines in volatile and core food items, which partially offset increases in services and regulated prices following higher household natural gas tariffs.
At the regional level, annual rural headline inflation rose to 8.3% in December 2025 from 7.9% in November. Meanwhile, annual nationwide headline inflation edged up slightly to 10.3% from 10.0% in the previous month.
Monthly food inflation registered negative 0.7% in December 2025, contributing a negative 0.26 percentage point to monthly headline inflation.
Food inflation drivers
The decline in food inflation during December was driven by several factors. Volatile food prices fell by 1.6%, contributing negative 0.09% to monthly headline inflation, broadly in line with seasonal patterns, albeit more pronounced. Prices of fresh fruits and vegetables declined by 2.3% and 1.0%, respectively.
Poultry prices fell for the third consecutive month, declining by 2.5% and contributing negative 0.11% to monthly headline inflation. Egg prices also dropped by 5.7%, contributing negative 0.09%.
Non-food inflation drivers
Monthly non-food inflation reached 0.8% in December, contributing 0.48% to monthly headline inflation.
Regulated prices rose by 0.6%, contributing 0.12%, mainly due to a 23.0% increase in household natural gas prices—the second hike in 2025—which alone contributed 0.11%. Additional upward pressures stemmed from a modest 0.2% increase in tobacco prices.
Prices of services increased by 0.9%, contributing 0.27% to monthly headline inflation, driven primarily by higher rents and increased spending at restaurants and cafés. Retail prices rose by 0.6%, contributing 0.08%, reflecting increases in clothing and footwear, household cleaning products and personal care items.
Monthly core inflation stood at 0.2% in December 2025, reflecting the combined impact of these developments. Core food contributed negative 0.24% to monthly core inflation, while services and retail items contributed 0.37% and 0.12%, respectively.",460,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9632568359375,2026-01-18T09:27:18.678156
2026-01-18,"Egypt, India explore deeper cooperation on climate action, waste management",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/18/egypt-india-explore-deeper-cooperation-on-climate-action-waste-management/,"Egypt’s Minister of Local Development and Acting Minister of Environment, Manal Awad, met with India’s Minister of State for External Affairs, Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Kirti Vardhan Singh, in Cairo to discuss expanding bilateral cooperation across a broad range of environmental and climate-related fields, the Egyptian Ministry of Environment said.
The talks, attended by senior officials from both sides, focused on strengthening cooperation in environmental emergency response centres, plastic waste reduction, climate change mitigation and adaptation, biofuels, water quality, wetland protection, biodiversity conservation, and the sustainable use of natural resources.
Awad said Egypt was keen to build on the expertise of its environmental institutions—particularly the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency—in areas such as environmental emergency preparedness and response, noting that this experience could support joint initiatives with India. She also highlighted Egypt’s interest in reducing plastic pollution and coordinating positions in ongoing international negotiations on a global plastics agreement.
The meeting reviewed opportunities for cooperation on renewable and alternative energy sources, including the production and use of biofuels, as well as measures to improve water efficiency, protect wetlands, and conserve biodiversity. Awad stressed that these priorities are closely linked to sustainable development goals and climate resilience efforts in both countries.
According to the ministry, discussions also included proposals to renew and expand cooperation with Indian research and policy institutions. These would cover the development of national and international environmental policies, the safe management of electronic and medical waste, and waste-to-energy solutions. Particular emphasis was placed on building technical capacity to manage agricultural waste, such as rice straw and sugarcane residues, and on transferring Indian biotechnology expertise to improve efficiency in this area.
Awad pointed to the potential benefits of Indian technical and economic cooperation programmes in training Egyptian professionals in environmental fields, saying such initiatives could strengthen Egypt’s ability to address environmental and development challenges. She added that Egypt welcomed increased Indian investment in environmental projects and green solutions.
The talks also touched on an invitation extended by the Indian embassy in Cairo for Egypt to join the International Big Cats Alliance, an Indian-led initiative aimed at protecting seven major species of big cats, including tigers, lions, and cheetahs.
Awad reaffirmed Egypt’s interest in deepening cooperation with India on environmental governance, climate action, and new and renewable energy, particularly green hydrogen and green ammonia. She noted that Egypt’s experience in reducing carbon emissions and advancing a just energy transition could provide a strong foundation for closer collaboration.
For his part, Singh welcomed enhanced cooperation with Egypt, praising Awad’s oversight of both the environment and local development portfolios. He highlighted the close link between social and local development and environmental policy, particularly in areas such as energy access and rural development.
Singh said renewable energy—especially solar power—is a cornerstone of India’s energy strategy, accounting for around 40% of its energy mix, and expressed interest in expanding cooperation with Egypt on bioenergy and extended producer responsibility. He also invited Egypt to consider joining an Indian-led initiative on climate-resilient infrastructure.
The meeting underscored the growing scope of environmental cooperation between Egypt and India, as both countries seek to align climate action with sustainable development and economic growth.",525,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7364314198493958,2026-01-19T09:37:04.114249
2026-01-18,Gold prices rise by EGP 325 since start of 2026 in Egypt: iSagha,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/18/gold-prices-rise-by-egp-325-since-start-of-2026-in-egypt-isagha/,"Gold prices posted strong gains in Egypt over the past week, tracking a parallel rise in global markets, with prices climbing by around 1.9% amid escalating geopolitical tensions and political uncertainty, according to a report by iSagha.
Saied Embaby, CEO of iSagha, said local gold prices increased by approximately EGP 115 over the week. The price of 21-carat gold opened at EGP 6,040 per gram and closed at EGP 6,155.
Globally, gold prices surged by about $86 per ounce, rising from $4,510 at the start of the week to $4,596 by the close of trading.
Embaby noted that 24-carat gold was priced at around EGP 7,034 per gram, while 18-carat gold stood at approximately EGP 5,276 per gram. The gold pound rose to about EGP 49,240.
He added that gold prices have increased by around EGP 325 since the beginning of the year, representing a growth rate of 5.6%, compared with gains of 4.3% recorded during the same period last year. On global exchanges, gold prices have risen by about $278, or 6.4%, approaching the 6.6% increase recorded in January of the previous year.
Sharp volatility
Geopolitical tensions and internal political developments pushed gold prices to record levels during the week, with volatility returning strongly to precious metals markets. Gold opened the week at $4,510 per ounce and jumped sharply to $4,600 following reports of a potential lawsuit by the US Department of Justice against the Federal Reserve.
After a brief pullback to $4,582, renewed political pressure on the Federal Reserve drove prices higher again to $4,616, before retreating to $4,586 and then climbing to $4,630 per ounce. Gold traded sideways between $4,580 and $4,630 on Tuesday and Wednesday, before surging to a weekly high of $4,640 on Wednesday afternoon.
Prices later entered a phase of relative stability, fluctuating between $4,585 and $4,620. Friday’s session saw sharp swings, with gold failing once again to break above $4,620, falling to a weekly low of $4,536 before rebounding to nearly $4,600 by the end of the week.
Profit-taking and dollar pressure
Gold prices fell by more than 1% on Friday as investors took profits following the recent rally, while easing geopolitical tensions reduced the metal’s safe-haven appeal. The decline was also driven by stronger-than-expected US labour market data, which dampened expectations for near-term interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, amid a firmer dollar and higher Treasury yields.
Federal Reserve signals
Market sentiment turned more cautious following remarks by Donald Trump regarding Federal Reserve leadership, while easing geopolitical risks followed reports that Israel had sought to delay any potential strike on Iran.
US economic data continued to signal resilience, with industrial production rising by 0.4% in December, consumer inflation holding at 2.7%, firmer producer prices, and a strengthening labour market. Together, these factors reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will proceed cautiously on interest rate cuts, prompting traders to scale back easing bets.
Market outlook
Embaby said underlying fundamentals remain supportive of gold prices, citing concerns over the independence of the Federal Reserve, persistent trade tensions, and continued gold purchases by central banks.
He added that any US military escalation against Iran could push prices significantly higher, suggesting gold could surpass $4,700 per ounce within the current month.
Markets are now awaiting the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision scheduled for 27–28 January, alongside key US economic data releases, including housing indicators, jobless claims, the final GDP reading, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, purchasing managers’ indices and consumer confidence figures, amid expectations of continued volatility in gold and precious metals markets.",588,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8341811895370483,2026-01-19T09:37:18.210022
2026-01-18,EGP 10.05bn injected into national veal project in 2025: Official,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/18/egp-10-05bn-injected-into-national-veal-project-in-2025-official/,"Tarek Soliman, Head of the Livestock and Poultry Development Sector within Egypt’s Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, said that approvals were granted in 2025 to disburse EGP 1.06bn to 1,122 beneficiaries for the breeding and fattening of 12,438 heads of livestock under the National Veal Project. This brought total funding injected into the project by the end of the year to EGP 10.053bn.
The project has benefited around 45,100 small-scale breeders, young graduates and women in villages covered by the Decent Life initiative for rural development, while the total number of livestock supported under the programme reached approximately 522,500 heads.
Soliman’s remarks came in a report reviewed by Minister of Agriculture Alaa Farouk on the performance of the livestock and poultry sector in 2025, particularly efforts to streamline licensing procedures and regulate feed registration in line with biosecurity standards.
He noted that 10,870 operating licences were issued during the year, including new and renewed licences for livestock, feed and poultry activities, as well as milk collection centres. This included 3,685 permits enabling small breeders to engage in livestock rearing in compliance with biosecurity and safety requirements, in coordination with the General Authority for Veterinary Services.
Soliman added that approvals were granted for the registration of 8,247 feed formulations, additives and concentrates, including 5,395 locally produced and 2,852 imported products, in accordance with scientific standards and national specifications. In addition, 610 technical approvals were issued for establishing new livestock and poultry projects in desert hinterlands, in line with preventive and biosecurity measures.
He also said that 50 milk collection centres were upgraded and modernised during 2025 to meet standard specifications, bringing the total number of developed centres to 300. Of these, 90 centres were financed through concessional funding exceeding EGP 517m, alongside 41 centres located within agricultural complexes in Decent Life villages, with work ongoing to complete the remaining projects.
Soliman stressed continued coordination with regulatory authorities and the launch of intensive, unannounced inspection campaigns targeting feed warehouses, raw materials, and feed production and trading activities across all governorates. More than 250 surprise campaigns were carried out in 2025, resulting in the seizure of 187 tonnes of non-compliant feed, including expired products and feed held for hoarding. Violators were referred to the Public Prosecution to safeguard market stability and quality standards.
He pointed out that applications for automated operating licences for livestock, poultry and feed activities can now be submitted through digital platforms, including the ministry’s official website, the Egypt Digital platform and government service mobile applications, in a move aimed at simplifying procedures and improving service accessibility.
On production, Soliman said 2025 marked a notable improvement, with domestic red meat output reaching around 600,000 tonnes, up from 555,000 tonnes in 2024, representing an 8% increase. Fresh milk production also rose by 8% year-on-year to 7 million tonnes.
Poultry production also recorded strong growth, with broiler output rising to around 1.6 billion birds in 2025, compared with 1.4 billion birds a year earlier. Egg production increased to 16 billion eggs from 14 billion, while local baladi chicken production reached 360 million birds, up from 320 million in 2024, marking a growth rate of 12.5%.",524,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.5908111333847046,2026-01-19T09:38:30.351432
2026-01-18,Title deed insurance opens new real estate investment opportunities in Egypt,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/18/title-deed-insurance-opens-new-real-estate-investment-opportunities-in-egypt/,"The Financial Regulatory Authority’s (FRA) introduction of real estate title deed insurance marks a significant step for Egypt’s property sector, strengthening investor protection and opening the door to greater foreign participation.
Moataz Shaarawy, Chief Executive Officer of Uptown 6 October Investment Group, described the move as a strategic tool that enhances confidence in real estate transactions and aligns Egypt more closely with international market standards.
“In markets such as the US and Europe, title deed insurance is a standard component of real estate transactions. With this initiative, Egypt is offering the same level of protection, making property investment more secure for both local and international investors,” Shaarawy said.
He noted that the policy has prompted Uptown 6 October to reassess its real estate portfolios, with the company exploring expansion into segments that were previously less accessible due to ownership and registration complexities. The group is also considering launching real estate investment funds targeting international investors, with a strong emphasis on transparency and regulatory compliance.
“These funds would enable global investors to participate with confidence, knowing that the underlying assets are legally protected,” Shaarawy added, highlighting the initiative’s potential to attract foreign currency inflows and support broader market growth.
He further stressed that title deed insurance would reinforce Egypt’s ambition to position itself as a regional hub for real estate investment, while contributing to job creation and increased foreign direct investment.
The introduction of title deed insurance reflects broader government efforts to strengthen market confidence, standardise investment practices, and foster a more competitive and attractive real estate environment in Egypt.",259,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8986356258392334,2026-01-19T09:38:49.151452
2026-01-18,FRA grants EGX first licence to operate derivatives trading,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/18/fra-grants-egx-first-licence-to-operate-derivatives-trading/,"The Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA), chaired by Mohamed Farid, has granted the Egyptian Exchange (EGX) its first licence to operate futures exchanges for derivatives based on securities listed on the Egyptian market. The milestone step reflects the FRA’s commitment to developing Egypt’s capital market infrastructure, diversifying investment instruments, and enhancing risk management in line with international standards.
Financial derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset, such as shares, price indices, or other instruments determined by the Authority. These include futures contracts, options, swaps, or other standardised agreements.
Speaking at a press conference attended by Islam Azzam, Chairperson of the Egyptian Exchange, Farid said the launch of a derivatives market is one of the key pillars of the FRA’s strategy to build a more advanced and sustainable financial market.
“The FRA has worked over many months to establish a regulatory and legislative framework suitable for derivatives trading in Egypt. Derivatives are globally recognised as essential tools for risk management, market stability, and attracting a broader investor base,” Farid said.
He noted that the licence was granted after completing full coordination with the EGX and Misr for Clearing, Settlement and Central Depository, ensuring the highest standards of governance, protection of market participants, and market integrity.
The launch of the derivatives market will take place in four phases: the first phase will introduce futures contracts on the EGX30 EWI, with trading expected to begin in March. The second phase will include futures on the EGX70 EWI, followed by futures on individual shares, and finally, options contracts on shares and indices. This phased approach is designed to build a stable, organised market capable of sustainable growth.
Futures contracts are standardised agreements to buy or sell securities or other financial instruments at a predetermined price on a future date. Farid highlighted that an integrated risk management system will be implemented to limit systemic risks and ensure market resilience against volatility.
Seven brokerage firms have already applied for licences to operate as futures brokers, reflecting strong local interest in the new market. Futures trading is expected to deepen the market, increase liquidity, and provide investors with advanced tools to hedge risks, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance portfolio management.
Islam Azzam praised Farid and the FRA for their efforts, noting that regular coordination and the development of a dedicated trading system have prepared the Exchange for futures and options contracts. He said foreign investment funds have already shown interest in trading derivatives in Egypt, signalling growing international confidence in the local market.
Risk management measures will be enforced through the clearing and settlement company, including membership requirements, initial and variation margins, contributions to a central counterparty guarantee fund, and allocations from the Investor Protection Fund.
During the conference, an illustrative example explained futures contracts using real estate: if a client expects property prices to rise, they could enter a futures contract to purchase a flat in one year at a fixed price of EGP 2m, paying an initial margin of EGP 200,000. Any price increase would yield gains before settlement, while a price drop would still obligate the client to complete the purchase, potentially resulting in a loss.",525,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.853590726852417,2026-01-19T09:38:54.206696
2026-01-18,Egypt’s property market remains stable with limited delivery delays: Real Estate Chamber,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/18/egypts-property-market-remains-stable-with-limited-delivery-delays-real-estate-chamber/,"Tarek Shoukry, Chairperson of the Real Estate Development Chamber at the Federation of Egyptian Industries (FEI), said delays in the delivery of residential units remain limited and do not reflect the overall health of Egypt’s real estate market.
Shoukry explained that delivery-related complaints are confined to a small number of developers, out of nearly 15,000 companies registered with the Real Estate Development Chamber. He added that the chamber, in coordination with relevant government entities, is working to resolve such cases in a manner that safeguards buyers’ rights without undermining confidence in the sector as a whole.
He stressed that any affected customer has the right to have their grievance addressed and resolved, noting that preserving market confidence remains a top priority.
Developers’ Federation
As part of broader regulatory efforts, Shoukry revealed that discussions are underway regarding the establishment of a Real Estate Developers’ Federation. The proposed body would classify developers based on experience, financial strength, and execution capacity, providing greater transparency for buyers and reducing the likelihood of future delivery delays.
He noted that the federation would have broader regulatory authority than the current chamber, including the power to impose penalties on non-compliant developers. These could range from downgrading developer classifications to licence withdrawal in severe cases. Linking state land allocation to developer classification, he added, would support more sustainable growth across the sector.
Shoukry pointed out that Egypt’s real estate market comprises more than 15,000 developers, reflecting the scale and importance of this vital sector. However, he said the large number also underscores the need for stronger regulation and a clearer institutional framework to ensure sustainable growth and balance between supply and demand.
Tarek Shoukry, Chairperson of the Real Estate Development Chamber at the Federation of Egyptian Industries (FEI)
He added that the wide spectrum of developers—from major companies executing large-scale projects to smaller firms operating on a limited scope—poses challenges related to the market’s capacity to absorb such a high number of players. This, he said, necessitates a reassessment of developers’ roles and existing operating mechanisms in line with market needs.
While this diversity helps broaden the real estate investment base, Shoukry noted that it also requires more precise legislation and regulatory tools to better organise relations between developers and clients and to ensure serious, timely project execution.
Market growth in 2025
Shoukry said Egypt’s real estate market recorded growth in 2025, stressing that performance should be compared with 2023 rather than 2024, which he described as an exceptional year driven by citizens seeking to protect their savings amid economic volatility.
According to chamber data, total real estate sales increased by around 4% year-on-year, signalling market stability—particularly when considering the performance of small and medium-sized developers alongside major companies.
He attributed sustained demand to Egypt’s population growth of more than two million people annually, as well as the cultural perception of real estate as a secure store of value.
Shoukry said real estate remains one of Egypt’s most effective tools for wealth preservation, noting that property prices over the past decade, even when measured in US dollars, have delivered consistent returns that outperformed currency fluctuations, bank interest rates, and stock market volatility.
Property export revenues
Shoukry also highlighted a sharp rise in Egypt’s real estate export revenues, which increased from around $500m to nearly $2bn over the past year.
He said the surge reflects growing confidence among foreign investors—particularly from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar—whose investments are increasingly driven by solid feasibility studies rather than speculative promotion.
He concluded that continued foreign investment inflows will play a critical role in supporting market stability and strengthening the long-term outlook for Egypt’s real estate sector.",606,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.7564888000488281,2026-01-19T09:39:08.795463

Companies are increasingly relying on market-aligned repricing, early-bird incentives, and promotional discounts to encourage direct purchases.

Balanced strategies
Impact on the resale market
Branded projects and digital tools
Financing solutions for buyers
Some developers have accelerated construction schedules to deliver near-complete units, while others are partnering with local banks to offer easier financing solutions. Several new projects have also been launched at prices reflecting the relative stability of the Egyptian pound and recent declines in the cost of certain construction materials.
However, these measures have had a noticeable impact on Egypt’s resale, or “secondary”, property market. While developers are offering extended instalment plans and attractive deals to new buyers, resale sellers often seek full cash payments plus a profit margin, making secondary-market transactions less competitive.
Most developers are now offering longer payment terms, reduced down payments, and cash discounts. As these policies have become increasingly widespread—particularly within the same geographic areas—some companies are seeking to differentiate themselves by targeting buyers through property exhibitions and international real estate events.
Balanced strategies
Abdallah Salam, President and CEO of Madinet Masr, said the company is pursuing a balanced approach that stimulates demand while preserving long-term value through competitive pricing, flexible payment options, and high-quality project execution that enhances client confidence.
Ahmed Al-Attal, Chairperson of Al-Attal Holding, said his company focuses on active buyer segments, accelerates construction to provide near-ready units, and organises site visits to strengthen trust with potential clients.
Similarly, Ahmed Samir El-Desouky, Head of the Commercial Sector at Wealth Holding, said the company is reviewing pricing policies that combine flexible instalment plans with cash discounts for serious buyers, without compromising product quality or development commitments.
Impact on the resale market
The shift towards longer payment periods and extended project timelines has significantly slowed resale activity. Abdelrahman Abu Zeid, Senior Sales Manager at Tasken, part of Nawy PropTech, said resale transactions for newly developed projects have declined by at least 70% compared with last year, as major developers now offer instalment periods extending to 12 years or more.
Abu Zeid explained that some resale units purchased during periods of currency volatility in 2023 and 2024 were priced higher than current offerings. As resale transactions are often cash-based, these units have become harder to sell compared with newly launched projects offering competitive pricing and extended payment plans.
Branded projects and digital tools
Attracting major international brands has become a key strategy for developers seeking to boost project visibility and sales. Around one-third of surveyed developers cited partnerships with global brands as a major marketing driver, while others are focusing on high-demand locations or hospitality-linked developments to capitalise on Egypt’s current tourism momentum.
Digital marketing campaigns and smart applications are also playing a growing role in analysing demand, managing client data, and improving customer engagement. Wealth Holding’s Head of the Commercial Sector noted that digital tools and targeted initiatives help raise conversion rates, simplify purchasing decisions, and enhance after-sales service.
Financing solutions for buyers
A limited number of developers are working with banks to facilitate long-term financing solutions. Daniel Doss, Board Member at Rock Developments, said the company has signed an agreement with a bank to offer financing covering up to 80% of a unit’s value for periods of up to 15 years, easing the purchasing process for buyers.
Real estate executives stressed that sustainable growth in Egypt’s property sector depends on financial discipline, delivery capability, and adherence to project timelines, rather than advertising budgets or aggressive expansion. Timely delivery, strategic repricing, branded partnerships, digital engagement, and tailored financing solutions, they said, are collectively helping developers build buyer confidence and support a healthier long-term real estate market.",630,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8546419143676758,2026-01-19T09:39:17.957660

The committee, established under United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803 and a 20-point peace plan proposed by President Donald Trump, will oversee Gaza’s stability, recovery, and reconstruction while the Palestinian Authority completes its internal reform programme. Commissioner General Dr Ali Shaath, who chaired the 15 January session, described the body’s formation as a “pivotal moment” in collective efforts to begin a new chapter for the territory. Shaath stated that the committee is a Palestinian entity created by Palestinians for Palestinians, with the formal support of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the Palestinian Authority, and various Palestinian factions.
The newly appointed administration is composed of a group of professional experts including Abdul Karim Ashour for agriculture, Omar Shamali for telecommunications and digital services, and Aed Abu Ramadan for economy, industry, and trade. Education is overseen by Dr Jabr Al-Daour, while Dr Bashir Al-Rayyes and Dr Aed Yaghi manage the finance and health portfolios respectively. Security and internal affairs are led by Sami Nesman, with Adnan Abu Warda handling justice, Osama Al-Saadawi managing lands and housing, Hana Tarazi overseeing social security, and Dr Ali Barhoum in charge of water, utilities, and local authorities.
In his first official act, Dr Shaath signed the NCAG mission statement, which pledges to transform Gaza’s transition into a foundation for permanent prosperity under the guidance of a “Peace Council” chaired by President Trump and supported by a High Representative for Gaza. The committee committed to restoring essential services such as electricity, water, healthcare, and education while establishing a productive economy aimed at providing equal opportunities to replace unemployment. The mission statement further emphasised the principle of “one authority, one law, and one weapon” as the basis for restructuring justice and security institutions within the territory.

2026-01-18,"FRA grants fintech licence to Granite, enabling Egypt’s first fully digital money market account",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/18/fra-grants-fintech-licence-to-granite-enabling-egypts-first-fully-digital-money-market-account/,"Granite Financial Holding, a digitally enabled asset management company, has received a fintech licence from the Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA), paving the way for the immediate launch of its proprietary mobile application, the Granite Money Market Account (Granite MMA).
The launch follows an FRA decision issued on Thursday authorising Granite to use fintech solutions to receive fund subscriptions and execute purchase and redemption orders for open-ended investment funds. The approval positions Granite among the leading financial institutions driving full digital adoption in Egypt’s asset management sector.
The introduction of the Granite Money Market Account comes at a pivotal time for Egypt’s financial landscape. With an estimated EGP 1.3trn in savings certificates set to mature starting January 2026, liquidity management has become a key focus, as banks and financial institutions compete to retain deposits amid shifting interest rate conditions.
Granite targets a different segment. Rather than competing for locked-in savings, the Granite Money Market Account is designed for individuals and institutions holding significant idle liquidity who seek to keep their cash fully accessible while generating competitive daily returns within a regulated money market framework, without lock-in periods.
For corporate clients, Granite offers an advanced digital dashboard providing real-time visibility over liquidity positions and cash flows. Combined with a tax-free return structure, the platform enables companies to move beyond passive cash holding towards a more disciplined and optimised approach to treasury management.
Founder and CEO of Granite Financial Holding Hisham Akram said that securing the fintech licence marked a critical milestone in the company’s strategy.
“Securing this digital licence is a crucial step in executing our vision. It reinforces our commitment not only to regulatory compliance, but also to contributing to the evolution of Egypt’s financial ecosystem. With this foundation in place, we are well positioned to modernise asset management through technology-led, client-centric solutions,” he said.
The platform aims to set a new benchmark for digital financial services by delivering a secure, seamless and trusted user experience. Through the mobile application, individuals can complete fully digital account opening and electronic know-your-customer (e-KYC) procedures within minutes, without paperwork or branch visits.
Users have 24/7 access to their funds, benefit from daily compounded returns, and face no lock-in requirements. The Granite Money Market Account can also be linked to any Egyptian bank account, allowing smooth transfers in and out.
Co-Founder and Managing Director Hussein El Sheikh said the product was designed with practical, everyday usability in mind.
“If you have excess cash that you want to keep liquid and accessible, the Granite Digital Money Market Account offers a safe, secure and easy-to-use solution,” he said.
Meanwhile, Co-Founder and Chief Technical Officer Mahmoud Moursy said the company prioritised security and compliance from the outset.
“We focused on security, compliance and performance at the infrastructure level, not as add-ons. We are not building another fintech app; we are building the next generation of regulated financial accounts,” he said.",482,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.4979414343833923,2026-01-19T09:39:28.045791
2026-01-19,Egypt signs $350m agreement to develop integrated textile industrial complex in New October City,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/19/egypt-signs-350m-agreement-to-develop-integrated-textile-industrial-complex-in-new-october-city/,"Egypt’s Deputy Prime Minister for Industrial Development and Minister of Industry and Transport, Kamel Al-Wazir, witnessed the signing of a contract to establish an integrated spinning and textile industrial complex in New October City, with initial investments estimated at $350m.
The project will be developed under the private free zones system on an area of approximately 800,000 square metres within Industria October Industrial City. The agreement was signed between Elsewedy Industrial Development and Crystal International Group, one of the world’s leading textile manufacturers.
The contract was signed by Mohamed AlKammah, CEO of Elsewedy Industrial Development, and Lo Ching Leung, Managing Director of Crystal International Group, in the presence of senior officials from the Ministry of Industry and representatives of both companies.
During the signing ceremony, Al-Wazir said the project aligns with the state’s strategy to revive and modernise the spinning and textile industry, deepen local manufacturing, increase value-added production, reduce import dependence, and boost industrial exports.
He noted that the selection of New October City reflects its strategic location and proximity to ports, modern road networks, and advanced transport infrastructure. Al-Wazir added that the project is fully consistent with Egypt’s sustainable development plans and will receive full government support, particularly if it expands to cover all stages of the value chain, including the local production of garment accessories, as well as dyeing and printing components.
The industrial complex will feature an integrated production system encompassing the spinning of natural and synthetic fibres, yarn production, advanced weaving, textile processing, finishing, and dyeing. This integrated approach is expected to enhance product quality, reduce waste, and strengthen the competitiveness of Egyptian textile products in global markets.
The project will rely on advanced manufacturing technologies and high-efficiency production systems, while adhering to environmental sustainability standards and ensuring the efficient use of energy and water.
Once operational, the complex is expected to create around 20,000 direct jobs, making it one of the largest labour-intensive projects in the textile sector and supporting the state’s efforts to generate sustainable employment and develop skilled industrial labour.
Representatives of Crystal International Group said Egypt was selected due to its advanced industrial infrastructure, availability of skilled labour, and strategic geographic location, which facilitates access to European, American, and Asian markets. They described the project as one of the group’s largest textile investments in the region.
For his part, Mohamed AlKammah said the project represents a major strategic addition to Egypt’s textile industry and reflects the confidence of leading global groups in the Egyptian investment climate. He added that developing the complex under the private free zones system will support textile exports and reinforce Egypt’s position as a regional hub for the spinning and textile industry, in line with the state’s vision for sustainable industrial growth and export expansion in the coming years.",462,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7764796614646912,2026-01-20T09:35:34.247939
2026-01-19,KOICA’s development portfolio in Egypt reaches $100m: Country Director,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/19/koicas-development-portfolio-in-egypt-reaches-100m-country-director/,"At a time when Egypt–Korea relations are gaining renewed momentum, development cooperation has emerged as a central pillar of this growing partnership. Against this backdrop, Dr Sooyoung Park, Country Director of the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) Egypt Office, spoke to Daily News Egypt following her arrival in Egypt last August, marking the beginning of a new chapter in bilateral development engagement.
In this interview, Dr Park discusses KOICA’s evolving cooperation with Egypt, outlining key priorities, strategic directions, and future opportunities as both countries seek to translate strong political ties into tangible and sustainable development outcomes aligned with Egypt’s Vision 2030.
Dr Park, many leaders specialise in either academia or operational work, yet you have reached the pinnacle of both as a PhD scholar and a Country Director. From your time as Director-General of the ODA Research Centre to leading the KOICA Egypt Office, you have consistently acted as an “architect” of national-level strategies. How do you view this dual role?
Thank you for the question. I see academic and operational roles not as separate specialisations, but as two sides of the same coin. One side addresses the questions of “why” and “what should be”, while the other deals with “how” and “what can be achieved”.
As former Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of International Development – Korea’s leading academic journal focusing on ODA policy and theory – my role was to shape discourse by clarifying principles and providing an intellectual compass for the field. This work naturally informs KOICA’s practice. My experiences in the Indonesia office and now in Egypt allow me to navigate using that compass, while continuously recalibrating it based on realities on the ground.
At the ODA Research Centre, I drafted strategic blueprints; here in Egypt, we are building a living structure. The true value of a blueprint lies not only in its elegance on paper, but in its resilience in practice. This creates a vital feedback loop: theory pushes us towards rigour and innovation, while implementation, through partnerships, cultural contexts, and unforeseen challenges, provides the data needed to refine our thinking.
My role is not about holding two distinct titles, but about stewarding a cohesive process. Sustainable development requires both deep reflection and decisive action. These two sides cannot exist independently if meaningful impact is to be achieved.
How do you assess the evolution of the KOICA-Egypt partnership and your mission for the years ahead?
It is both a privilege and a personal joy to lead the KOICA Egypt Office at this important stage of our shared development journey. For more than three decades, KOICA has stood alongside Egypt as a trusted partner in advancing sustainable and inclusive growth.
Today, we continue this partnership with renewed momentum, investing in people and innovation in support of Egypt’s Vision 2030. I firmly believe that effective cooperation is built on dialogue, mutual respect, and a shared sense of purpose.
Together with our Egyptian counterparts and all development partners, we will continue turning ideas into action and opportunities into lasting impact for communities, for the planet, and for future generations.
What is the scale and history of KOICA’s work in Egypt?
KOICA’s engagement with Egypt began in 1991 through the dispatch of volunteers and experts. In 1998, we formally inaugurated our country office, marking a deeper commitment to Egypt’s development as the Korean government’s primary grant aid and technical cooperation agency.
Since then, our partnership has expanded significantly. Key milestones include:
Projects:
Since 1998, KOICA has implemented around 30 major projects focusing on technical education, industrial development, and the improvement of government services.
Across its programmes in Egypt, KOICA actively enhances government efficiency through the digitalisation of public services and systems. We also promote economic growth by prioritising Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) to build a skilled workforce and stimulate industrial development. In parallel, KOICA addresses gender-based violence and champions women’s economic empowerment, with a strong focus on increasing female labour market participation and supporting vulnerable groups to ensure no one is left behind.
Capacity-building:
More than 2,000 Egyptian government officials have participated in KOICA capacity-building programmes in Korea, including Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, who attended KOICA’s urban development programme in 2001. We have also supported around 140 master’s degree graduates.
Volunteers:
From 1991 to 2024, approximately 467 KOICA volunteers have contributed to community development and youth empowerment across Egypt.
To date, KOICA’s development portfolio in Egypt has reached $100m.
KOICA President with Egypt’s Prime Minister, the Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation, and the Former Korean Ambassador to Egypt.
What are KOICA’s focus sectors in Egypt?
The Korean government has selected Egypt as the sole ODA priority partner in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region for the 2021-2025 period.
Accordingly, a Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was developed in consultation with the Egyptian government and aligned with Egypt’s Vision 2030. The CPS focuses on five priority sectors: transportation; environment and energy; public administration; education; and communication and information technology.
Based on this framework, the KOICA Egypt Office developed its Country Plan, which aims to enhance capacity for sustainable development and reduce economic and social inequality. The plan rests on three pillars that directly support the Sustainable Development Goals: employment and youth participation; digital transformation of government; and the promotion of gender equality and social integration.
Currently, the Office is undertaking a comprehensive review of the Country Plan to update and align its strategic objectives with the evolving development priorities of the Egyptian government. This process aims to ensure that all interventions remain coherent, results-oriented, and fully supportive of Egypt’s national development agenda.
With the conclusion of the 2021-2025 CPS cycle, how do you see the next phase of cooperation, particularly in light of the SHINE Initiative announced by the Korean President at Cairo University?
Following the conclusion of the 2021-2025 Country Partnership Strategy, the next phase of the KOICA-Egypt partnership will be significantly shaped by the SHINE Initiative, announced by the President of the Republic of Korea, Mr.
Lee Jae-myung, during his address at Cairo University.
The SHINE Initiative serves as a comprehensive framework for cooperation with the Middle East, emphasising the promotion of regional peace, deeper economic partnerships, and enhanced cultural and people-to-people exchange.
SHINE stands for Stability, Harmony, Innovation, Network, and Education, and reflects Korea’s strategic vision to strengthen cooperation in areas such as energy security, trade, innovation, and human capital development.
Within this context, KOICA is keen to align its future programmes and activities in Egypt with the SHINE Initiative while remaining fully responsive to Egypt’s national development priorities. Through this alignment, we aim to further elevate our strategic partnership and contribute to shared prosperity, resilience, and long-term sustainable development.
How is KOICA supporting Egypt’s digital transformation agenda?
Leveraging Korea’s recognised leadership in digital governance, KOICA is supporting Egypt through several flagship projects. These include the online one-stop service system for patent registration and approval, completed in 2022 in cooperation with the Egyptian Patent Office and now fully operational. The system reduced the patent application process by 176 days and handled 2,048 online applications in its first year.
KOICA is also working with the General Authority for Government Services (GAGS) to introduce an e-procurement system for public procurement, with a budget of $7.9m. This one-stop system covers the entire procurement process, from bidding and evaluation to contract payment, while ensuring the confidentiality of bidding documents and enhancing transparency and credibility. The system is expected to be fully launched by the end of 2026.
In addition, KOICA is partnering with the General Organisation for Export and Import Control (GOEIC) on the project “Establishment of a Digital Platform for Risk-Based Inspection and Tracking to Facilitate Trade in Egypt” (2025-2029). The project aims to streamline import inspection procedures through digital systems, improve customs clearance efficiency, and ensure compliance with international trade standards, thereby strengthening Egypt’s global competitiveness.
Looking ahead, an extension project for integrated Intellectual Property (IP) services is being prepared in cooperation with the Egyptian Intellectual Property Authority (EGIPA). KOICA is also finalising a Digital Transformation (DT) Programme Results Framework, outlining a long-term partnership strategy and identifying future projects to align with Egypt’s Digital Egypt initiative.
How will KOICA’s support for vocational and technological education evolve?
A notable success story is the Egyptian-Korean Faculty of Technological Industry and Energy at Beni Suef Technological University, established with KOICA’s support. Initially launched as a two-year programme, it was upgraded to a four-year programme in 2019 to align with changes in Egypt’s educational policies. Between 2016 and 2022, KOICA established Mechatronics and ICT programmes, developed curricula, supplied modern equipment, and strengthened staff capacities.
Building on the success of the first phase, KOICA is currently implementing a second-phase project (2023-2028) aimed at developing comprehensive four-year bachelor’s degree curricula in Mechatronics, ICT, and Autotronics, alongside the establishment of a new specialised department in Railway Technology.
A key focus of this phase is the creation of a “bridge to jobs” through a University-Industry Cooperation Centre (UICC), ensuring that graduates are not only academically qualified but also smoothly integrated into the labour market, with particular emphasis on women’s economic empowerment and increased female participation in the technology sector.
In vocational education, KOICA is also expanding into emerging industries, particularly green technology. A recent example is the project “Upgrading Green Automotive Maintenance Technology for VTCs in Egypt”, launched in cooperation with PVTD and the Ministry of Transport and Industry, aimed at upgrading four vocational training centres and developing specialised curricula aligned with the green economy.
How do KOICA’s projects promote gender equality and women’s empowerment in Egypt?
KOICA aims to support all women and girls, including refugees, who are affected by gender-based violence and discrimination that limits their economic and social participation. In partnership with the National Council for Women and UN agencies such as UNFPA, UN Women, WFP, and UNHCR, we implement programmes to prevent and respond to violence in families, schools, workplaces, and communities.
These initiatives empower women and girls to become more resilient and self-reliant, enabling them to realise their full potential and contribute to building a more inclusive and prosperous society.
How will KOICA’s capacity-building programmes evolve, and how is their impact measured?
Capacity-building programmes are the cornerstone of sustainable development. KOICA is evolving these initiatives to focus more strongly on future-oriented skills such as environmental protection, green technology, and digital governance.
Beyond participant numbers, we apply a strengthened results-based management framework to assess long-term impact. This includes tracking alumni career progression, contributions to policy reform, and the application of knowledge through annual knowledge-sharing seminars. We also foster robust alumni networks, such as the community of more than 2,000 Egyptian officials trained through KOICA programmes, to create lasting communities of practice that drive institutional change.
Last year marked the first visit by a KOICA President to Egypt. Are there plans for further high-level KOICA visits to Egypt?
The Korea International Cooperation Agency views Egypt as a pivotal strategic partner and a cornerstone of its development cooperation efforts in the region. The successful visit of the KOICA President last year marked an important milestone, underscoring the depth of mutual trust and shared vision between our two countries.
Egypt’s designation as a Priority ODA Partner for the 2021-2025 period reflects the strategic importance Korea places on this partnership. Within this framework, KOICA remains engaged in continuous high-level consultations to ensure close alignment with Egypt’s national development goals.
Our focus remains on sustained dialogue, strong institutional cooperation, and identifying new opportunities that reflect the growing importance of Egypt-Korea relations.",1909,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.7979631423950195,2026-01-20T09:35:43.955026
2026-01-19,AfDB provides $170m to Egypt for economic diversification and sustainability,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/19/afdb-provides-170m-to-egypt-for-economic-diversification-and-sustainability/,"Egypt and the African Development Bank (AfDB) have signed a $170m agreement for the second phase of the Private Sector Development and Economic Diversification Support Program (PSD-EDSP II) to support the state budget and advance structural reforms.
The Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation, Rania Al-Mashat, and AfDB Country Manager Abdourahmane Diaw signed the agreement on Monday. The deal includes an additional $400,000 (EGP 19m) grant to enhance environmental sustainability at the Abu Rawash Wastewater Treatment Plant.
The signing ceremony was attended by Deputy Minister of Finance Yasser Sobhi and Deputy Minister of Housing Sayed Ismail. The Ministry of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation stated that the agreement forms part of efforts to coordinate with national entities and maximise relations with multilateral partners to implement the National Structural Reform Program.
Al-Mashat said the agreement is part of broader government efforts to mobilise concessional financing, expand fiscal space for human development programs, and advance structural reforms. She noted that AfDB’s private-sector-directed financing operations in 2025 were three times higher than government operations.
“This underscores Egypt’s openness and readiness for new partnerships and foreign investments that can drive innovation, sustainable growth, and long-term development,” Al-Mashat said.
The PSD-EDSP II follows the first phase of the program, which the House of Representatives approved in December 2024 with a value of $131m.
Regarding the Abu Rawash Wastewater Treatment Plant, one of the world’s largest, Al-Mashat emphasised that the grant aims to improve operational efficiency. This follows an agreement signed in May to finance the plant’s fourth phase, which seeks to increase treatment capacity from 1.6m cubic metres per day to 2m cubic metres per day.
The project is expected to benefit approximately 8.6m residents in the Giza Governorate by providing water suitable for agriculture and protecting local ecosystems.
The ministry previously announced that concessional financing to support the state budget between 2023 and 2026 amounts to approximately $9.5bn. These funds are intended to support macroeconomic stability, improve the investment climate, and stimulate Egypt’s transition to a green economy.",337,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9140557050704956,2026-01-20T09:35:58.222733

The financing agreement was signed during a ceremony attended by senior executives from both parties, including Dasha Badrawi, Executive Vice Chairman of MARAKEZ; Osama Ezzo, Chief Financial Officer of MARAKEZ; Amr Abdel Wahab, Head of Corporate Banking at KFH-Egypt; and Ihab El-Shafei, General Manager of Corporate Banking. The signing marks a key milestone in MARAKEZ’s expansion strategy in Egypt.
The facility will fund the extension of the fully leased Mindhaus Campus, adding around 17,000 square metres of gross leasable office area. The transaction aligns with KFH-Egypt’s strategy of financing high-quality developments that support sustainable commercial growth.
Exclusively designed for leasing, the new extension responds to rising demand from companies seeking integrated, high-specification work environments within District 5. The existing Mindhaus Campus has reached full occupancy, driven by its integrated ecosystem, premium amenities, and strategic location within the mixed-use development.
District 5 offers direct access to retail destinations, banking services, dining outlets, and lifestyle facilities, creating a fully integrated and well-connected business environment. Reflecting this strong demand, MARAKEZ has established a waiting list for office space, highlighting sustained interest from companies seeking flexible, high-quality offices within a mixed-use destination.
The upcoming expansion is designed to accommodate this growing demand while further strengthening District 5’s position as a leading commercial and business hub in East Cairo.",264,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.924396514892578,2026-01-20T09:36:17.464807
2026-01-19,IMF raises Egypt economic growth outlook to 5.4% for FY 2026/27,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/19/imf-raises-egypt-economic-growth-outlook-to-5-4-for-fy-2026-27/,"The International Monetary Fund has revised its growth forecasts for Egypt upwards to reach 5.4% in the fiscal year (FY) 2026/27, citing a positive shift in economic indicators. In its January 2026 World Economic Outlook Update, the IMF raised Egypt’s GDP growth projection for the FY 2025/26 to 4.7%, which represents a 0.2 percentage point increase from its October forecast. The outlook for the following FY 2026/27 was upgraded more significantly by 0.7 percentage points to 5.4%.
The revision for Egypt comes as the IMF projects growth in the Middle East and Central Asia to accelerate from 3.7% in 2025 to 3.9% in 2026 and 4.0% in 2027. This regional momentum is supported by higher oil output, resilient local demand, and ongoing reforms, with Saudi Arabia specifically projected to grow by 4.5% in 2026 and 3.6% in 2027. On a global scale, the IMF expects growth to remain resilient at 3.3% in 2026 and 3.2% in 2027, rates similar to the estimated 3.3% outturn in 2025. The 2026 global forecast marks a small upward revision of 0.2 percentage points compared with the October 2025 report.
The IMF noted that global performance results from a balancing of divergent forces where headwinds from shifting trade policies are offset by tailwinds from surging investment related to technology and artificial intelligence11. This technological surge is particularly evident in North America and Asia12. Global headline inflation is expected to decline from an estimated 4.1% in 2025 to 3.8% in 2026 and 3.4% in 2027, returning to target more gradually in the United States than in other large economies.
Growth in the United States is projected at 2.4% in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027, supported by fiscal policy and technology-driven investment incentives under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025. In China, growth for 2026 was revised upward to 4.5%, reflecting stimulus measures and a yearlong trade truce with the US that lowered effective tariff rates, though growth is expected to moderate to 4.0% in 2027 due to structural headwinds. India is expected to see growth moderate to 6.4% in 2026 and 2027 as cyclical and temporary factors wane following a strong 7.3% outturn in 2025.
The euro area is expected to see steady but subdued growth of 1.3% in 2026 and 1.4% in 2027, as it faces unresolved structural headwinds and benefits less from the recent technology-driven investment boost compared to other regions17. Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to see growth accelerate to 4.6% in 2026 and 2027, supported by macroeconomic stabilisation and reform efforts in key economies like Nigeria.
Risks to the global outlook remain tilted to the downside, as a reevaluation of productivity growth expectations about AI could lead to a decline in investment and trigger an abrupt financial market correction. Trade tensions could also flare up, prolonging uncertainty and weighing more heavily on activity. On the upside, rapid AI adoption could lift global growth by as much as 0.3 percentage points in 2026 if it translates into strong productivity gains and increased business dynamism. To foster stability, the IMF recommends that policies focus on restoring fiscal buffers, preserving price and financial stability, and implementing structural reforms without further delay.",527,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.6663787961006165,2026-01-20T09:36:26.844181
2026-01-19,FRA issues regulations governing insurance coverage for medical errors under government fund,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/19/fra-issues-regulations-governing-insurance-coverage-for-medical-errors-under-government-fund/,"The Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA) has issued regulations governing insurance operations covered by the Government Fund for Insurance against Risks Arising from Medical Errors, as part of efforts to enforce the provisions of the Unified Insurance Law and the Law Regulating Medical Liability and Patient Safety.
The regulations set out a framework for determining annual insurance premiums for medical professionals and facilities based on the nature of their activities, while obliging the fund to conduct actuarial studies to ensure fair pricing and long-term financial sustainability.
Mohamed Farid, Chairperson of the FRA, said the new rules represent an important step towards establishing a sustainable insurance system that enhances patient protection and regulates the professional liability of medical practitioners and facilities on clear, insurance-based foundations aligned with international best practices.
Under the system, the fund will compensate beneficiaries for cases of death, disability, or bodily injury resulting from medical errors, in accordance with the terms of the issued insurance policy. Compensation may be provided directly by the fund or through contracts with one or more insurance companies or an insurance pool approved by the FRA.
FRA Decision No. 303 of 2025 stipulates that the fund’s board of directors must mandate an actuarial expert registered with the authority to prepare an actuarial study based on actual experience during the fund’s first three years of operation. Additional studies may be conducted whenever necessary to reassess and determine appropriate pricing.
The decision sets the annual premium for individual medical professionals at EGP 240 for general practitioner physicians and EGP 920 for specialist physicians. For dentists and physical therapy practitioners, premiums are set at EGP 160 for general practitioners and EGP 400 for specialists, while pharmacists are charged EGP 240 annually. Other licensed medical professions are subject to an annual premium of EGP 100. Newly graduated practitioners will benefit from a 25% discount during their first professional licensing period.
For medical facilities, the annual premium is set at EGP 24,000 for hospitals with up to 50 beds, with an additional EGP 500 for each extra bed. Premiums are set at EGP 9,600 for medical centres, EGP 3,600 for radiology centres, EGP 2,400 for laboratories, and EGP 1,200 for pharmacies.
Premiums were determined based on actuarial studies prepared by certified experts in coordination with the FRA, the Ministry of Health and Population, and the Federation of Medical Professions Syndicates, ensuring balanced pricing that takes into account the interests of medical professionals subject to the law.
The regulations are issued in implementation of Prime Ministerial Decision No. 3973 of 2025, which approved the fund’s statute in line with relevant legislation and executive decisions issued by the FRA.
Subscription to the fund is mandatory for practising medical professions, as well as for obtaining and renewing professional licences and licensing medical facilities.
The fund has an independent legal personality and reports to the Minister of Health and Population. It operates an official website for the disbursement of compensation following amicable settlements or final court rulings. The fund and its branches are subject to FRA supervision and are registered in the authority’s designated register.
The fund may also contribute to covering other damages resulting from medical errors, excluding cases where medical liability is absent or where fraud or deception is involved. It retains the right of recourse against parties responsible for gross negligence, those operating beyond the scope of their licences, using unlawful means, or refusing to provide emergency treatment.
The issuance of these regulations forms part of the FRA’s broader efforts to build an integrated insurance system that balances the protection of medical service recipients with the financial sustainability of the fund.",602,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.9059629440307616,2026-01-20T09:36:36.776173

During the year, the company sold 4,462 units, while the number of delivered units rose sharply to 1,941 units, compared with 645 units in 2024, representing a 201% year-on-year increase.
The results underscore Madinet Masr’s solid financial position and the effectiveness of its strategy to expand its land bank and develop a diversified portfolio of projects in strategic locations. The company said its approach continues to deliver sustainable value to customers while supporting Egypt’s Vision 2030 for urban development.
Commenting on the performance, Abdallah Sallam, President and CEO of Madinet Masr, said the significant increase in deliveries marked a key milestone for the company. “The 201% rise in delivered units compared to 2024 underscores our commitment to executing our projects to the highest standards of quality and efficiency, in line with our customers’ expectations,” he said.
Throughout 2025, Madinet Masr continued to implement its expansion strategy through the launch of new projects and the formation of strategic partnerships, all of which recorded strong market demand. This performance reflects growing confidence in the company’s brand and its ability to deliver integrated real estate developments that respond to evolving market needs.
During the year, the company signed a strategic partnership to develop Prism, the first commercial and entertainment destination in Tajed, the commercial district within Taj City. It also launched Talala in New Heliopolis, a strategically located development spanning two land plots with a combined area of 491.41 feddans and total investments of EGP 90bn.
In addition, Madinet Masr introduced Elm Tree Park, developed over an area of 476,262 square metres, equivalent to 113 feddans, with total sales of EGP 20bn.
The company also signed partnerships with leading construction firms to accelerate development works across several projects, including Club Side in Taj City, as well as Elan, Rai, and Rai Views in Sarai.
Madinet Masr said these partnerships form part of its efforts to deliver fully integrated residential solutions aligned with the latest sustainable engineering and architectural standards, while supporting plans to further develop its land bank and drive targeted growth.
Looking ahead, the company aims to continue enhancing its land portfolio, which spans more than 12.8 million square metres, through the development of new residential and commercial projects that meet the highest standards of efficiency and quality.",396,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9516918659210204,2026-01-20T09:36:47.344399
2026-01-19,"Egypt targets competitiveness, private capital as reforms enter delivery phase: Investment Minister",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/19/egypt-targets-competitiveness-private-capital-as-reforms-enter-delivery-phase-investment-minister/,"Hassan El-Khatib, Minister of Investment and Foreign Trade, said Egypt has decisively moved from a phase of stability to one of execution, noting that with macroeconomic stability restored, the focus has shifted to enhancing competitiveness, driving export-led growth and attracting private investment. These reforms, he explained, are aimed at supporting listed companies, deepening capital markets and creating sustainable long-term value for investors.
El-Khatib made the remarks during his participation in a meeting of leading global founding investors, organised by EFG Hermes—the investment bank of EFG Holding and a leading financial institution in the Middle East and North Africa—as part of the Egypt Investment Forum. The meeting was attended by Karim Awad, Group Chief Executive Officer of EFG Holding, alongside senior representatives of international investment institutions and Ghada Nour, Assistant Minister of Investment for Investment Affairs, Promotion and Government Offerings.
The minister said the Egyptian government has prioritised restoring confidence in the national economy over the past year, describing it as the essential gateway to achieving sustainable growth and enhanced competitiveness. He explained that current economic policies follow a logical sequence that begins with stability, progresses through reform and culminates in effective execution, ultimately delivering attractive investment returns.
El-Khatib pointed to more than $550bn in infrastructure investments implemented across ports, road networks, logistics, energy and digital infrastructure. He stressed that these investments were designed to address long-standing structural bottlenecks rather than achieve superficial expansion, noting that the current phase focuses on enabling the private sector to maximise returns from this ready infrastructure.
He said Egypt’s economic reform programme rests on four integrated pillars: monetary policy, fiscal policy, trade policy, and redefining the role of the state as a regulator and enabler of economic activity. These pillars, he added, are being implemented simultaneously to ensure a tangible and sustainable improvement in the investment climate.
On monetary policy, El-Khatib said the shift towards inflation targeting marked a pivotal step in restoring credibility, as reflected in improved macroeconomic indicators. Net foreign assets have returned to surplus, remittances from Egyptians abroad have risen to $36.5bn, inflation declined to around 12% in November, and foreign reserves increased to nearly $50bn—developments that have collectively restored confidence and stabilised the exchange market.
Regarding fiscal policy, the minister said it is being implemented under the leadership of the Minister of Finance with a focus on achieving discipline without undermining growth. Measures include simplifying the tax system, resolving tax disputes, expanding digitalisation and setting a clear cap on public investment to avoid crowding out the private sector. The objective, he said, is to achieve a competitive effective tax rate that enhances Egypt’s investment appeal.
El-Khatib also noted that, for the first time, the government has conducted a comprehensive inventory of all non-tax fees and charges to address a key concern for investors—namely, the multiplicity of fees and collection authorities. This step, he said, will help reduce costs and time while improving transparency.
On trade policy, El-Khatib described it as a central tool for supporting investment and export-led growth, noting that work is under way to finalise Egypt’s first trade policy document since 2002. The goal, he said, is to expand exports, stressing that Egypt does not suffer from an import problem, as around 85% of imports are production inputs and about 10% are essential goods, with additional imports supporting sectors such as tourism. He added that Egypt aims to rank among the world’s top 50 exporting countries.
“To achieve the required increase in export figures, we are working to boost both foreign and domestic direct investment by encouraging hundreds of companies to invest in Egypt,” El-Khatib said.
He added that customs clearance times have been reduced from 16 days to 5.8 days, with a target of reaching just two days by the first quarter of 2026. These reforms have already generated estimated savings of $1.5bn, expected to rise to $2.1bn once fully implemented. He also highlighted the launch of a new export rebate programme based on clear rules and a commitment to disbursement within 90 days.
El-Khatib said Egypt’s extensive network of trade agreements provides exporters with access to multiple markets, noting that Africa represents a major opportunity for expanding exports. Egypt’s geographic location and trade agreements, he added, position the country as a gateway to African markets.
He explained that the state has redefined its role in economic activity through the State Ownership Policy, which clearly sets out areas of government participation and exit, ensuring that the state no longer competes with private investors.
The minister stressed that digital transformation represents the main execution engine of reforms rather than a purely procedural exercise. He noted that the Business Ready 2026 programme includes 209 reforms based on private-sector-led standards, while platforms such as electronic licensing, the Egyptian Business Gateway and the National Trade Platform have unified the investor journey and reduced overlap among government entities.
During the meeting, El-Khatib addressed questions from international investors regarding private sector participation and measures to attract further investment. In this context, he said Egypt currently attracts average annual foreign direct investment of around $12bn, with a target to double this figure. Achieving this, he added, will depend on continued efforts to promote investment in priority sectors, particularly new and renewable energy, tourism and industry, supported by infrastructure development and port modernisation.
He concluded by noting that ongoing projects along the North Coast are set to transform Egypt’s tourism landscape, highlighting large-scale developments being implemented in partnership with the private sector, which contribute to job creation and broader development objectives.",915,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.6140729784965515,2026-01-20T09:37:23.266706

The project combines Samara’s strong leadership and deep market presence in the Kingdom with the manufacturing and mobility expertise of Raya Holding through its mobility arm and portfolio company, Raya Auto. The joint venture aims to localise the assembly of electric golf carts, provide comprehensive after-sales services, and develop skilled local talent to serve key sectors including hospitality, tourism, construction, and urban development.
The initiative comes in response to growing demand for efficient and sustainable mobility solutions across large-scale projects in Saudi Arabia. It is expected to contribute to job creation, technology transfer, and the development of local manufacturing capabilities, in line with the Kingdom’s economic diversification goals under Vision 2030. Production is targeted to exceed 3,000 electric golf carts over the next two years.
Commenting on the partnership, Bader AlShathry, Chairperson of Samara Land Transportation Services Company in Saudi Arabia, said the joint venture marks a step toward establishing a “Saudi-assembled” standard for electric mobility. He noted that the partnership integrates advanced connectivity solutions with best-in-class after-sales support, delivering a quality-driven customer experience rooted in long-term vision and local value creation.
Ahmed Khalil, Group CEO of Raya Holding, said the collaboration reflects Raya’s commitment to sustainable mobility and industrial localisation in the Kingdom.

“This joint venture reinforces our long-term commitment to the Saudi market and aligns closely with Vision 2030 objectives for industrial localisation and sustainable economic growth,” Khalil added.
Juan Carlos Azcona, CEO of Samara Land Transportation Services Company in Saudi Arabia, described the partnership as a milestone in shaping the future of mobility in the Kingdom. He emphasised the companies’ shared commitment to delivering cutting-edge, environmentally friendly transportation solutions that support Saudi Arabia’s evolving infrastructure and urban development needs.
Meanwhile, Mohamed El-Naggar, CEO of Raya Auto, said the joint venture builds on Raya Auto’s proven track record in Egypt’s electric mobility sector, where it has developed integrated solutions across electric golf carts, e-buses, and electric vehicles. He noted that the same comprehensive model—covering manufacturing, distribution, and after-sales services—will be applied in Saudi Arabia to ensure operational excellence and market leadership.",412,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7690789103507996,2026-01-21T09:35:01.214357
2026-01-20,Opinion | The Future of the Arabian Gulf in the Event of a Potential U.S.-Israeli Strike on Iran,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/20/opinion-the-future-of-the-arabian-gulf-in-the-event-of-a-potential-u-s-israeli-strike-on-iran/,"The possibility of a U.S.-Israeli strike on Iran presents an exceptional scenario that could redraw the contours of security and stability in the Arabian Gulf. With Iran’s internal tensions escalating and its controversial nuclear programme ongoing, the Gulf has become the epicentre of global attention—not only geopolitically, but also economically, strategically, and socially.
In the event of strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities or military bases, a potential Iranian response would represent the greatest challenge to Gulf security. Iran, equipped with advanced ballistic missiles, could target key U.S. bases such as Al Udeid in Qatar or Al Dhafra in the UAE, and may even attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz, threatening international shipping and compelling Gulf states to strengthen their maritime defence capabilities. On a less conventional front, Iran could also carry out cyberattacks on vital infrastructure in Gulf countries, including energy grids and banking networks, further amplifying security risks and introducing a cyber dimension to the conflict.
On the other hand, weakening the Iranian Revolutionary Guard could reduce the threat of unconventional attacks on Gulf oil facilities, as witnessed in 2019. However, this power vacuum may provide extremist groups with opportunities to expand, complicating regional security dynamics. Gulf states, reliant on alliances with the United States, might see an increased U.S. military presence on their soil, offering additional protection but simultaneously making them direct targets in any potential escalation.
Economically, any strike on Iran would immediately drive oil prices higher, potentially surpassing $150 per barrel if the Strait of Hormuz were closed. This could yield short-term gains for producers such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE but would expose the global economy to recessionary pressures due to rising energy costs. Alternative shipping routes and global trade would face disruptions, compounding regional and international economic strain. Conversely, Gulf states might accelerate their economic diversification strategies, as exemplified by Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 and the UAE’s digital transformation plans. Countries such as Qatar, with economic ties to Iran, could face challenges in natural gas exports, while Oman, maintaining its traditional neutrality, could play a pivotal role in economic and diplomatic mediation.
Internationally, such escalation could prompt China and Russia to expand their influence in the Gulf through trade agreements and investments, potentially reducing U.S. dominance and paving the way for a multipolar economic landscape. The regional investment climate may also be affected, as foreign investors could perceive the area as less attractive for sectors such as real estate, tourism, and services, despite short-term oil profits.
Politically, a strike could reinforce alignment between Gulf states and Israel, particularly in the wake of the Abraham Accords, with Iran viewed as a common threat. Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which have implicitly supported previous strikes, may further strengthen ties with Tel Aviv in intelligence and technology domains, despite potential domestic backlash among Arab public opinion, which largely still views Israel as a historical adversary.
Weakening Iran may also allow Iraq to emerge as a regional power, though its stability would hinge on managing the consequences of a potential Iranian collapse. Qatar risks regional isolation if it fails to adapt to these shifts, whereas Oman could maintain its mediating role in diplomatic efforts following a strike. Turkey’s and Pakistan’s regional roles should also be monitored, as their policies and interventions may be affected, further complicating the political landscape and reshaping alliances in the region.
In the long term, this scenario could open avenues for political solutions to regional conflicts such as Yemen and Lebanon, given Iran’s reduced influence. Yet the resulting strategic vacuum may spark new sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shia communities, deepening Gulf divisions. Launching diplomatic initiatives and regional conferences to secure maritime routes and protect economic stability will be essential to avoid prolonged chaos.
The future of the Arabian Gulf in the wake of any U.S.-Israeli strike on Iran is a complex mix of opportunities and risks. While it may lead to relative stability by weakening the Iranian threat, it also carries the potential for global escalation, economic shocks, and social and political challenges. The region must enhance economic resilience, develop robust regional diplomacy, and engage in comprehensive dialogue to ensure security and peace from within, rather than relying on external military solutions.

2026-01-20,Egypt targets 70% private sector investment by 2030 following 5.3% quarterly growth: Al-Mashat,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/20/egypt-targets-70-private-sector-investment-by-2030-following-5-3-quarterly-growth-al-mashat/,"Egypt is targeting a rise in the private sector’s share of total investment to over 70% by 2030, Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation Rania Al-Mashat said on Tuesday, following a 5.3% GDP growth rate in the first quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2025/26.
The quarterly growth, which exceeded government expectations, was driven by a recovery in the industrial sector and strong performance in tourism and ICT. Al-Mashat, speaking to CNBC Arabia at the World Economic Forum in Davos, noted that the Suez Canal has returned to a positive contribution to GDP after two years of decline, as major shipping lines resume transit through the waterway.
The government is currently implementing “governance of public investments” to limit state spending and create space for private capital. The private sector currently accounts for approximately 65% of total investments, with the state focusing on structural reforms in tradable sectors such as manufacturing, energy, and agriculture to reach the 2030 target.
Al-Mashat also highlighted the second edition of the “National Narrative for Comprehensive Development,” a strategy that integrates economic and social policies. This framework, developed with input from 120 experts, will be presented to the new House of Representatives and includes a specific focus on human development, education, and universal health insurance.
To ensure transparency, the government has for the first time published a National Programme for Structural Reforms with specific timelines and performance indicators. This includes the adoption of “programme and performance-based budgeting” across all ministries to track progress on per capita growth and job creation.
The minister concluded that the primary goal of these reforms is to ensure macroeconomic stability and improve the quality of life for citizens by fostering a competitive business environment and supporting the transition to green energy.",291,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.903908908367157,2026-01-21T09:35:50.102841
2025-10-06,Egypt’s economic transformation unlocks new investment opportunities: Citi,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/10/06/egypts-economic-transformation-unlocks-new-investment-opportunities-citi/,"As Citi marks 50 years of operations in Egypt, the global banking group is reaffirming its long-term commitment to the country’s economic transformation and integration into global markets.
In an exclusive interview, Ernesto Torres Cantú
,
Citi’s
Head of International, discusses the bank’s long-standing role in Egypt—from sovereign financing and capital markets development to green finance. Cantú shares Citi’s perspective on the evolving global investment landscape, the promise of Egypt’s economic reforms, and how Citi is positioning itself in a more digital, fragmented, and sustainability-driven world.
How much financing has Citi provided to Egypt since it began operations here, and in which sectors have you focused the most?
Citi’s vision is to be the preeminent banking partner for clients with cross-border needs. Global corporations truly value our physical presence in over 90 markets around the world, including in Egypt where we have served clients for the past 50 years.
We have the best local talent in Egypt, led by Mohamed Abdel Kader who celebrates his 30th anniversary with the firm this year. We have built longstanding relationships with clients, regulators, and the community. We know the regulations, we know the land, we know how to help you navigate the environment.
Citi is honored to have been a key player in developing Egypt’s capital markets, serving multinational companies, local corporates, financial institutions, and global custodians. We have been an active partner in sovereign financing, helping Egypt tap international capital markets as the joint lead and joint bookrunner for most of the Egyptian Eurobonds for the past ten years. We are also among the top hedging banks for the Egyptian Government.
Citi has played an important role in market infrastructure, from custody services that support foreign investor participation in local debt markets, to innovations in payments and transaction services that facilitate financial flows. These contributions have helped to increase market depth and liquidity, which ultimately benefit both the economy and the private sector.
We appreciate the support from the government, and our clients for giving us their preference – it is a privilege that we need to keep earning every day.
What are Citi’s expectations for future investments and capital inflows into Egypt?
Egypt’s economy has done well over the last year, bringing in investment, particularly into important areas like building, tourism, and industry. This increase in investment was helped by a more flexible currency exchange rate and higher interest rates.
We believe that ongoing spending on infrastructure, energy, and technology, and a focus on keeping inflation in check, will promote a stronger and more diversified economy.
What is the strategic significance of your visit to Egypt at this specific timing?
I am visiting as we celebrate Citi Egypt’s 50th anniversary, underscoring our deep and enduring commitment to the country. Citi has played an important role in Egypt’s economic journey – from facilitating landmark transactions to supporting the evolution of its financial markets – and we look forward to serving our clients here for many years to come.
Many emerging markets face a “green premium” when issuing sustainable bonds. What is Citi’s view on reducing this cost for countries like Egypt to access ESG financing more competitively?
Green bonds price at a yield premium in emerging markets when compared to those in Western Europe, but this is a function of the underlying credit quality and ratings of the borrowers. We would expect two identical bonds from an EM issuer – one conventional and one green – to trade at roughly the same yield, perhaps with the green bond trading a little bit lower than the conventional.
In MEA, where infrastructure and digital finance are rapidly growing, how is Citi positioning itself?
In infrastructure, Citi is providing financing and project support to governments for essential public works. For example, Citi provided financing for renewable energy projects in South Africa, contributing to essential public works and infrastructure development.
In digital finance, we are actively adopting instant payment systems and are recognized as a leader in digital banking. Our aim is to make money movement instant and programmable, and we are exploring solutions like tokenization. Citi is also improving digital collections through integration with local electronic payment platforms and automated trade products.
Citi has committed to financing $1 trillion in sustainable finance by 2030. How do you see Egypt and the wider MENA region fitting into this ambition? Do you see appetite among international investors for green instruments from Egypt?
The Egypt government’s support of renewable energy projects and launch of sovereign green bonds, shows a clear commitment to sustainable development. This aligns with the interest we have seen from clients to diversify energy resources and the transition to low-carbon growth.
Citi is actively supporting Egypt’s green ambitions, by offering advisory services, capital raising, and connecting investors with opportunities in renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure.
Citi led the first Egyptian Government green bond issuance for $750 million in 2020. This was five times oversubscribed, demonstrating strong investor interest in such green instruments.
Global
In your view, are we witnessing the final chapter of globalization, or simply the start of a new, more fragmented global economy?
We see a fundamental shift in global trade and capital flows, and our global network was built to support our clients precisely in such moments of uncertainty and volatility.
We believe that Egypt’s infrastructure development, especially the Suez Canal economic zone and connectivity initiatives, will continue to play a critical role in global supply chains. This, combined with ongoing digital transformation and a young population, provide a strong foundation for long-term competitiveness.
With geopolitical and economic uncertainties rising, how do you see the role of global banks like Citi evolving?
For our clients, these changes are creating pathways for growth, especially for businesses that can adapt quickly and build more resilient value chains. In many countries, we are the only bank that has had a consistent physical presence, connected to the most global network. This allows us to bring not only global insights but also unique solutions for clients who want to expand abroad.
If you are a CEO or a chief financial officer of a business that wants to start operations in a new market, you would want a bank who can meet you this afternoon – and we can do that. We can also help you in the process of starting up your business because we have the on the ground expertise.
Risk management of course remains a priority, taking into account geopolitical considerations and the impact of new technologies such as AI.
How are global liquidity and capital inflows shifting, and what role is Citi playing in facilitating them?
The US continues to be the largest recipient of capital flows globally and we are actively supporting foreign direct investment and outbound trade. Our digital platforms are further enabling more seamless cross-border transactions.
We also see a shift in emerging markets from traditional foreign currency bank lending towards local currency bonds and equities. We continue to help emerging markets to access international capital markets, particularly for local currency instruments, and helping clients understand the impact of major central bank policies on capital flows.
How is Citi preparing its international operations for the shift toward digital-first and AI-driven banking?
Today, approximately 175,000 colleagues across 80 jurisdictions are using Citi GenAI, with plans to expand throughout the year .
This is transforming how we operate, improving client experiences, accelerating work and enabling faster decision making. For example, we are using GenAI to improve call routing for clients and streamline the creation of complex credit reports.",1255,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7446849346160889,2026-01-21T09:35:59.725311

The project is being developed on an area of 98 feddans and offers a diverse mix of residential units, including standalone villas, townhouses, and apartments, designed to cater to a wide range of housing needs. According to the company, construction will occupy only 13% of the total land area, while the remaining 87% is allocated to open and green spaces, pedestrian pathways, and community services.
Grand Lane features an integrated master plan that includes commercial zones, a social club, landscaped gardens, and a range of recreational facilities. The development also incorporates approximately 5,200 square metres of water features, providing open views for nearly 80% of residential units, alongside swimming pools and underground parking facilities.
A central green corridor, known as the Green Spine, extends through the project for approximately 1.7 kilometres, enhancing connectivity and walkability. Residential offerings include apartments with one to three bedrooms ranging from 68 to 195 square metres, townhouses sized between 169 and 203 square metres, and standalone villas ranging from 235 to 251 square metres.
HDP is offering flexible payment plans during the launch phase, with down payments starting at 5% and instalment periods extending up to 14 years.
As part of the project’s development, HDP has signed agreements with the US-based architecture and urban planning firm OBMI, in addition to DMA for Design and Engineering Consultancy, to design the project’s master plan in line with international planning, sustainability, and design standards.
Commenting on the launch, Amgad Hassanein, Vice Chairperson of HDP, said the company aims to develop integrated residential communities that enhance quality of life through sustainable design and comprehensive services.
HDP CEO Hossam Eissa added that Grand Lane is designed to create a balanced residential environment that seamlessly integrates housing, everyday services, and expansive green spaces within a unified urban framework.
The launch of Grand Lane forms part of HDP’s broader strategy to expand its portfolio of residential developments across Egypt’s new urban communities.",359,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.5922824144363403,2026-01-21T09:36:55.667505
2026-01-21,Opinion | The Strategic Evolution of Egypt’s Personal-Care  Manufacturing,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/21/opinion-the-strategic-evolution-of-egypts-personal-care-manufacturing/,"After more than two decades leading manufacturing and consumer-goods operations across international markets, my outlook on Egypt’s personal-care sector remains resolutely optimistic. We are witnessing a fundamental shift where the industry is no longer defined by cost efficiency alone. Instead, it is being reshaped by scale, export readiness, and the ability to operate as a sophisticated, integrated end-to-end value chain.
Egypt possesses the essential structural pillars required to compete on the global stage, including geographic proximity to key markets, a maturing industrial base, and a workforce increasingly capable of meeting international standards.However, these advantages are merely the baseline. The true differentiator in today’s volatile market is leadership discipline. Success now hinges on the ability to transform local manufacturing platforms into resilient, export-driven ecosystems that are robust enough to withstand inflationary pressures, navigate supply-chain volatility, and adapt to the rapid shifts in consumer demand.
Throughout my career, I have championed a singular operational philosophy known as “From Source to Sell.” By optimizing the full value chain and ruthlessly strengthening unit economics, I have led large-scale transformations that achieved 2X and 3X growth. The results of this model speak for themselves, as we successfully expanded exports to more than 30 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. In several instances, export volumes reached 80% of total production while increasing local content to 65%. This is a model that aligns directly with Egypt Vision 2030, positioning the nation as a strategic industrial hub for the region and the world.
In the modern industrial landscape, sustainability and human capital are no longer peripheral concerns but rather economic imperatives. Environmental stewardship, through energy-efficient manufacturing and responsible sourcing, is essential for long-term competitiveness in a world that demands carbon accountability. Simultaneously, we must align workforce capabilities with global benchmarks through a “capability-first” approach. This requires a dedicated focus on TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) reform and aggressive leadership development to ensure our talent can compete at the highest levels.
My approach to industry is informed by what many call the “4-Dimensional Strategist” framework, which bridges the gap between corporate transformation, national policy advisory, executive coaching, and the grit of endurance athletics. As a certified ICF executive coach and an endurance athlete, I view industrial transformation as a marathon rather than a sprint. It requires a rare blend of long-term vision and the relentless, day-to-day execution of a disciplined competitor.
As Egypt’s manufacturing sector continues to mature, my focus remains steadfast on scaling globally competitive platforms and fostering the next generation of leadership. By building sustainable industrial frameworks, we do more than improve business performance; we contribute to a national legacy of development and economic resilience.

Speaking at a dialogue session on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Al-Sisi invited investors to capitalise on opportunities within the Egyptian market, citing the country’s logistical capabilities and a legislative environment designed to facilitate business. The President emphasised that Egypt’s stability is fundamentally rooted in the”awareness and understanding of the Egyptian people,” which has allowed the nation to navigate the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.
Presidency spokesperson Mohamed El-Shennawy said the session, moderated by WEF Interim Co-Chair André Hoffmann and Managing Director Maroun Kairouz, included chief executives from the energy, digital transformation, transport, and financial sectors. Hoffmann stated that the meeting reflected Egypt’s international standing and aimed to showcase Sisi’s vision for private sector involvement in the state’s comprehensive development plans.
Sisi outlined a strategy focused on expanding the private sector’s role, including the implementation of the State Ownership Policy document and an initial public offering (IPO) programme. These measures, along with a ceiling on public investment, have led to an increase in the private sector’s share of total investment in Egypt, El-Shennawy said.
The President highlighted specific incentives in priority sectors, such as the
“Golden License”
programme, the Green Hydrogen Incentives Law, and tax reforms managed through a unified digital platform. These initiatives target industries including electric vehicle manufacturing, information technology, and renewable energy.
Regarding macroeconomic performance, Al-Sisi noted that Egypt’s economic programme, conducted in cooperation with international financial institutions led by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has resulted in improved indicators. These include higher credit ratings, increased growth rates, an improved balance of payments, and a rise in foreign reserves, alongside a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio.
In a separate meeting, Al-Sisi held talks with WEF President and Chief Executive Børge Brende to discuss global challenges and development. Brende expressed appreciation for Egypt’s participation and noted that the forum had dedicated a special session to Egypt to review its vision for Middle East challenges and regional security.
Brende praised Al-Sisi’s personal efforts to consolidate regional stability and expressed a desire to continue coordination with the Egyptian government to boost economic growth and attract further investment.
The Presidency spokesperson added that the dialogue with business leaders also touched upon the modernisation of Egypt’s infrastructure. Sisi pointed to the development of road networks, ports, and the Suez Canal Economic Zone. He noted that shipping companies are gradually returning to the Suez Canal following the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit, reinforcing the waterway’s role as a pivotal corridor for international trade.
Sisi also discussed the
Egypt Industry 2030
strategy, which seeks to increase the industrial sector’s contribution to GDP, and ongoing efforts to achieve universal health coverage by upgrading medical infrastructure and technology in partnership with the private sector.",492,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8375836610794067,2026-01-22T09:34:57.914521

During the meeting, the board approved a package of measures aimed at stimulating tourism investment. These include rescheduling instalment payments for tourism development and investment companies, without affecting the deadlines for subsequent payments, within the framework of facilitation measures previously endorsed by the board.
The approved package also includes extending the grace period granted to tourism development and investment companies that have obtained initial approvals and are committed to settling their financial obligations. This extension will allow companies additional time to complete initial approval procedures and proceed with final land allocation steps.
El-Sherbiny reaffirmed the government’s support for serious investors in hotel projects, stressing that all necessary incentives are being provided to expand hotel room capacity in line with the state’s tourism growth targets.
The meeting also reviewed the authority’s revenues achieved between 1 July 2025 and 20 January 2026, which reached approximately EGP 4.689bn—equivalent to 294% of the targeted revenues for the same period of the current fiscal year.
In addition, the minister noted that the authority is currently updating its technical regulations governing standards and requirements, as part of ongoing efforts to further improve the investment climate in the tourism sector.

2026-01-21,Egypt private sector investment grows 73% as ministers seek expanded EBRD support,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/21/egypt-private-sector-investment-grows-73-as-ministers-seek-expanded-ebrd-support/,"Egypt’s private sector investment grew by 73% over the past year and continued to rise by 48% in the first quarter of the current year, Minister of Investment and Foreign Trade Hassan El-Khatib said during meetings with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) on Wednesday.
Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, El-Khatib and Finance Minister Ahmed Kouchouk met with EBRD officials to discuss increasing the bank’s investments in Egypt and enhancing the competitiveness of the national economy. El-Khatib attributed the investment surge to economic reforms implemented over the last 18 months, which he said have significantly improved macroeconomic indicators and built trust with the business community.
As part of a new initiative to maximise state resources, El-Khatib announced that the government will repurpose former state-owned buildings into “leading hotel and service projects.” The move is intended to generate dollar revenues, create investment opportunities, and stimulate sustainable economic development.
The ministers stated that the government aims to establish a “fair competitive environment” that allows the private sector to lead economic growth. Discussions with the EBRD also focused on a comprehensive support package for Egyptian companies, aimed at improving energy efficiency, opening new markets, and encouraging sustainable export growth.
Finance Minister Ahmed Kouchouk presented Egypt’s tax reform experience as a successful model for building trust with taxpayers. He noted that facilitation measures led to a 35% increase in tax revenue—the highest growth rate in years—achieved through voluntary compliance and the settlement of outstanding files rather than the imposition of new financial burdens.
EBRD representatives expressed the bank’s commitment to supporting Egypt’s export programmes and infrastructure projects. The officials stated the EBRD is prepared to facilitate the transfer of international expertise and provide technical support to Egyptian firms in the fields of energy and resource efficiency to enhance regional and internationalcompetitiveness.
The meeting also addressed raising targets for foreign direct investment (FDI), with El-Khatib noting that sustained momentum depends on continued structural reforms and the improvement of the overall investment climate.",335,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9323588609695436,2026-01-22T09:35:18.947339

Held under presidential patronage, the fair will run from 21 January to 3 February and is being billed as the largest in its history in terms of both participation and activities.
This year’s edition is organised under the slogan “One who stops reading for an hour falls centuries behind,” a quote by Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz, who has been named Personality of the Fair. Renowned artist Mohieddin El-Labbad was selected as Personality of the Children’s Book Fair, while Romania is participating as guest of honour.
The opening ceremony was attended by several cabinet ministers, the Grand Mufti of Egypt, the governor of Cairo, diplomats and senior officials, as well as members of parliament, writers, intellectuals and media figures. Romania was represented by Culture Minister András István Demeter and Ambassador Olivia Toderean.
Madbouly praised the continuous development of the Cairo International Book Fair in recent years, saying the steady growth in international participation, diversity of exhibitors and expansion of exhibition space reflect the fair’s prominent position on the Arab and regional cultural map. He stressed that the event underscores Egypt’s commitment to promoting culture and thought as key pillars of its soft power and its long-standing role as a regional cultural hub.
Minister of Culture Ahmed Fouad Hanno said the current edition is the largest in the fair’s history, with the participation of 1,457 publishing houses from 83 countries and more than 6,600 exhibitors. He added that the cultural and intellectual programme includes around 400 events, over 100 book-signing ceremonies and 120 artistic performances, featuring Egyptian, Arab and international writers and artists.
Hanno noted that this year’s fair places special emphasis on Egypt’s ancient civilisation and heritage, coinciding with the recent opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum. He added that several new initiatives are being launched, including the “Library for Every Home” project, aimed at restoring books to daily family life, and the “Ahlena wa Nasna” camp, which highlights Egypt’s intangible cultural heritage across its governorates.
The programme honouring Mahfouz includes intellectual seminars, film screenings and artistic activities, most notably the exhibition “Naguib Mahfouz Through the Eyes of the World,” featuring works by artists from several countries. Activities celebrating El-Labbad include specialised seminars, an exhibition of his works, interactive children’s programmes, reprints of selected publications and a commemorative book documenting his artistic career.
During his tour of the fair, Madbouly visited pavilions of several ministries and state institutions, including the ministries of culture, defence and interior, the Administrative Control Authority, the Central Bank of Egypt and the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics, which announced that Egypt’s population has reached 108.6 million.
He also toured the pavilions of Al-Azhar, Dar Al-Ifta, the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs and the National Reading Pavilion, as well as the Financial Regulatory Authority, which showcased its initiatives to promote financial literacy. The Cabinet’s Information and Decision Support Centre presented its research publications, digital platforms and smart applications.
At the Romania pavilion, Madbouly was briefed on the guest of honour’s cultural programme, which includes 30 events involving 60 participants, as part of preparations to mark 120 years of diplomatic relations between Egypt and Romania in 2026.
Concluding his tour, the prime minister praised the high level of organisation, the diversity of participating pavilions and the dedicated children’s area, as well as the prominent tribute to Mahfouz. He said the Cairo International Book Fair continues to strengthen its role as a leading platform for cultural dialogue, a key supporter of the publishing industry and an important gateway for spreading knowledge and public awareness.",624,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.6849719285964966,2026-01-22T09:35:27.084859
2026-01-21,ETA launches mobile app for electronic payment of real estate transaction tax,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/21/eta-launches-mobile-app-for-electronic-payment-of-real-estate-transaction-tax/,"The Egyptian Tax Authority (ETA) has launched a new mobile application that allows taxpayers to pay real estate transaction tax electronically and obtain tax clearance certificates in a fast and convenient manner, according to Rasha Abdel Aal, the ETA chairperson.
Speaking at a meeting organised by the Swiss Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, Abdel Aal said the ETA will continue expanding its digital services in line with directives from the Ministry of Finance to strengthen communication with foreign chambers of commerce. She noted that these chambers play a key role in representing investors, conveying their challenges, and gathering feedback on the second package of tax facilitation measures ahead of its official launch.
She added that these efforts support the improvement of Egypt’s investment climate, enhance partnership with the private sector, and help build mutual trust with the business community.
Abdel Aal explained that digital transformation and the introduction of electronic tax systems have resulted in a qualitative shift in tax administration, facilitating the submission of tax returns, improving access to services, reducing procedural burdens, and boosting voluntary compliance. She emphasised the Authority’s continued cooperation with major international companies to develop tax systems in line with global best practices.
She further noted that expanding the tax base and integrating the informal economy into the formal system is a central pillar of the current strategy. In this context, she highlighted the simplified tax system for businesses with annual turnover of up to EGP 20m, which offers clear incentives, including a proportional income tax ranging from 0.4% to 1.5% based on turnover brackets, as well as exemption from tax audits for five years from the date of joining the system.
Abdel Aal said the first package of tax facilitation measures helped establish a new framework for engagement with taxpayers by allowing the submission and amendment of tax returns without penalties or fines. This approach strengthened mutual trust and encouraged businesses to regularise their tax positions through cooperation and transparency.
She added that the second package of facilitation measures builds on this foundation and includes 26 provisions aimed at addressing practical challenges and rewarding compliant taxpayers. Key measures include reducing the time required for value-added tax (VAT) refunds and simplifying related procedures.
Abdel Aal also revealed that the ETA plans to launch a “Tax Excellence Card” for compliant taxpayers, which will grant fast-track access to procedures, services from the Advance Ruling Unit and the Investor Support Unit, and expedited VAT refunds.
In addition, she said the package includes the development of a central electronic offsetting system, allowing taxpayers’ credit and debit balances to be offset electronically. This is expected to shorten processing times, simplify settlement procedures, and address administrative challenges related to tax dues.
Abdel Aal noted that the Authority has issued a comprehensive guide on the tax treatment of exported services, outlining the definition of exported services, rules for determining the place of taxation, and required documentation. The guide includes practical examples and is aligned with international standards to ensure stability in cross-border commercial transactions.
She stressed the ETA’s continued formation of joint committees with foreign chambers of commerce, including the Swiss Chamber, to promptly address investor concerns. She added that all inquiries raised by Swiss companies regarding income tax, VAT, and the automated tax system have been resolved.
During the meeting, Abdel Aal received the first edition of the Swiss Chamber of Commerce’s detailed report on Swiss business activity in Egypt. The report showed Swiss investments of $676.4m in fiscal year 2022/2023 and $600.6m in 2023/2024, bringing total investments to an estimated $1.2bn–$1.3bn. It also highlighted the implementation of 443 projects in Egypt and the creation of approximately 25,000 direct jobs.",609,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.773855984210968,2026-01-22T09:36:11.140856

Agricultural exports accounted for nearly 24% of Egypt’s total exports, highlighting agriculture’s role as a key driver of economic growth.
Farouk described 2025 as an exceptional year for agricultural exports, with total export volumes reaching around 9.5 million tonnes—an increase of more than 800,000 tonnes compared with 2024.
An official report issued by the Central Administration of Agricultural Quarantine showed that citrus fruits topped Egypt’s export list at 2 million tonnes, reinforcing the country’s position as the world’s largest orange exporter for the sixth consecutive year. Potatoes ranked second at 1.3 million tonnes, followed by sweet potatoes, which recorded a significant surge to 387,000 tonnes.
Other major exports included 336,000 tonnes of fresh and dried beans, 288,000 tonnes of fresh onions, 191,000 tonnes of grapes, 136,000 tonnes of pomegranates, 126,000 tonnes of mangoes, 68,000 tonnes of tomatoes, and 64,000 tonnes of strawberries, with particularly strong growth in demand from European markets.
The minister said the strong performance reflects the success of the state’s strategy to enhance food security while positioning agriculture as a major source of foreign currency. He noted that Egyptian agricultural products enjoy a high level of trust in international markets due to their adherence to strict quality standards. Currently, Egypt exports around 405 agricultural products to 167 countries worldwide, reinforcing its status as a major global agricultural supplier.
Farouk praised the efforts of all stakeholders across the export value chain—from farmers to exporters—highlighting the pivotal role played by the agricultural quarantine authority and reference laboratories in ensuring product safety, as well as the importance of international agricultural relations. He stressed that the ministry continues to coordinate with relevant authorities to open new and non-traditional markets, overcome logistical and procedural challenges, and sustain export growth.
He also pointed to the full digitisation of agricultural quarantine services, which has streamlined inspection and certification procedures, reduced customs clearance times, and accelerated export processes.
In a related development, Mohamed El-Mansi, Head of the Central Administration of Agricultural Quarantine, said that more than 25 new export markets were opened in 2025, particularly in East Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. He highlighted several measures that have enhanced the competitiveness of Egyptian agricultural exports, including the farm coding system, which ensures full traceability from field to final consumer, alongside strict compliance with international phytosanitary and quality standards—factors that have helped Egyptian products gain an edge in European and Gulf markets.",428,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9120585322380066,2026-01-22T09:36:33.691886
2026-01-21,Egypt’s current account deficit narrows 45.2% on surging remittances and tourism,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/21/egypts-current-account-deficit-narrows-45-2-on-surging-remittances-and-tourism/,"Egypt’s current account deficit narrowed by 45.2% to $3.2bn during the first quarter of the fiscal year (FY) 2025/26, supported by a significant surge in remittances and growth in the services sector.
Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) data for the July-September 2025 period showed the deficit falling from $5.9bn in the same quarter a year earlier. The improvement was driven primarily by a 28.4% increase in net unrequited current transfers, which reached $10.7bn. Within this category, remittances from Egyptians working abroad rose 29.8% to $10.8bn, compared to $8.3bn in the previous year.
The services surplus also grew by 23.4% to reach $5bn. Tourism revenues climbed 13.8% to $5.5bn as tourist nights increased to 58.7 million from 51.6 million. Additionally, Suez Canal transit receipts rose 12.4% to $1.05bn, supported by an 8.6% increase in net tonnage and a 2.5% rise in transiting vessels.
The non-oil trade deficit retreated by US$ 390.2 million to stand at $9.5bn. Non-oil merchandise export proceeds grew to $9.8bn from $7.9bn, led by gold, household appliances, vegetables, fruits, and ready-made clothes. However, non-oil import payments also rose to $19.3bn from $17.7bn, driven by vehicles, spare parts, corn, polymers, and telephones.
Gains in the current account were partially offset by a wider oil trade deficit, which grew by $946.6m to reach $5.2bn. This was largely due to a $1bn increase in oil imports, totalling $6.4bn, following higher purchases of natural gas and crude oil. The investment income deficit also edged up 2.3% to $4.4bn.
The capital and financial account recorded a net outflow of $366.4m, a reversal from the $3.8bn net inflow seen in the prior year. This shift was attributed to a $5.3bn increase in banks’ foreign assets abroad.
Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Egypt registered a net inflow of $2.4bn, down slightly from $2.7bn. FDI in the oil and mineral resources sector achieved a net inflow of $9.3m, following a net outflow previously. Non-oil FDI inflows included $1.2bn in reinvested earnings, $800.8m in greenfield investments or capital increases, and $520.2m in real-estate purchases by non-residents.
Portfolio investment in Egypt saw a net inflow of $1.8bn, compared to a net outflow of $384.7m a year earlier. Medium- and long-term loans recorded a net repayment of $1bn, with principal repayments of $2bn outweighing disbursements of $965.1m.
Despite the narrowing current account deficit, the overall balance of payments (BoP) recorded a deficit of $1.6bn for the quarter, compared to a deficit of $991.2m in the same period of the previous financial year.",413,daily_news_egypt,error,0.0,2026-01-22T09:36:47.239931

“Egypt has prioritised strengthening the role of the private sector as a principal and indispensable partner in the journey of growth and economic development,” Al-Sisi said. He detailed a strategy involving a cap on government investments and a “well-studied plan” for the state to exit specific sectors to allow for private expansion. Addressing an audience of world leaders and international executives, Al-Sisi emphasised that Egypt is moving forward with its State Ownership Policy Document, which defines the roles of state-owned enterprises and outlines a government programme for divestment and public offerings aimed at doubling the private sector’s contribution to the economy.
The president noted that these structural reforms, coupled with disciplined fiscal and monetary policies, have already led to a noticeable improvement in economic performance. He cited rising growth rates, increased private investment flows, and recent credit rating upgrades as evidence of restored investor confidence. Al-Sisi further argued that investors choosing to work in Egypt gain access to a broader horizon through a network of free trade agreements across African and Arab markets, rather than just the domestic market.

During an interactive dialogue following his speech, Al-Sisi also touched on the geopolitical environment, stressing that regional stability is a prerequisite for economic prosperity. He reiterated Egypt’s call for a just settlement of the Palestinian issue based on a two-state solution, while praising recent US-led efforts toward a ceasefire in Gaza as a pivotal step for regional de-escalation.

The move reflects the bank’s commitment to strengthening financial inclusion, accelerating digital transformation, and encouraging a culture of saving across all segments of society.
Maya Morsi, Minister of Social Solidarity and Chair of Nasser Social Bank, said the introduction of the new certificate underscores the bank’s ongoing role in offering attractive banking products that respond to citizens’ needs and contribute to financial stability. She noted that NSB continues to develop its savings instruments in line with current economic requirements, balancing both social and economic objectives.
Morsi added that the “Sanad” certificate is available starting from EGP 1,000 and in multiples thereof, with returns calculated from the day following the deposit. Customers are also permitted to borrow against the certificate under facilitated terms, in accordance with applicable regulatory rules.
Meanwhile, Osama El-Sayed, Deputy Chair of the Board, said that as part of the bank’s focus on serving different segments of society—particularly senior citizens—and in line with its social and solidarity mandate, NSB will continue to offer the “Rad El-Gamil” certificate for seniors. The three-year certificate offers an annual return of 18.25% paid yearly, or 16.75% paid monthly, with the aim of supporting decent living standards for elderly citizens.
El-Sayed also noted that the bank provides a wide range of additional savings products, including certificates offering a cumulative return of up to 20.5% over three years, paid at maturity, and a cumulative return of 18.5% over 18 months, also paid at maturity. These are in addition to a three-year certificate with an 18% annual return, 17% paid quarterly, or 16.5% paid monthly, as well as the continued availability of the “Yom Beyom” account, which offers a cumulative daily return of 11.75%.

The planned issuances, which will be executed by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) on behalf of the government, are aimed at refinancing maturing debt instruments and financing the state’s general budget deficit.
Under the plan, the CBE will conduct 106 tenders during the quarter, including 52 treasury bill tenders worth EGP 2.15trn, 48 treasury bond tenders valued at EGP 519bn, and six sukuk tenders totalling EGP 34bn.
Issuances are scheduled to amount to EGP 816bn in January, EGP 843bn in February, and EGP 1.044trn in March, according to the ministry’s data.
Treasury bills will include EGP 325bn with a 91-day maturity, EGP 530bn with a 182-day maturity, and EGP 615bn with a 273-day maturity. In addition, 364-day treasury bills worth EGP 680bn are scheduled to be issued during the quarter.
On the bond side, the government plans to issue two-year treasury bonds worth EGP 151bn, including EGP 35bn with variable interest rates. Three-year bonds worth EGP 271bn are also planned, including EGP 9bn with variable returns, alongside five-year bonds valued at EGP 97bn, of which EGP 16bn will carry variable returns.
The issuance programme further includes six local sukuk tenders with fixed returns, with a total value of EGP 34bn.
Banks operating in the Egyptian market remain the largest investors in treasury bills and bonds regularly issued by the government to finance the general budget deficit. These instruments are offered through 15 banks participating in the Primary Dealers system in the primary market, which then resell part of the issuances in the secondary market to individual and institutional investors, both domestic and foreign.
In a previous statement, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said the government is targeting a reduction in public debt as a percentage of GDP to levels not seen in Egypt for around 50 years. He noted that efforts are already underway, particularly as interest rates begin to decline.
Minister of Finance Ahmed Kouchouk has also stressed the government’s commitment to allocating a significant share of the exceptional proceeds from recent investment deals directly towards reducing public debt. He said the government has already succeeded in cutting budget-sector debt by around 10% of GDP over the past two years.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance’s Media Observatory clarified that each issuance of local debt instruments is matched by corresponding repayments and redemptions of previously issued tenders, ensuring continued management of the government’s debt obligations.",429,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.84693443775177,2026-01-25T09:24:32.425283
2026-01-24,Africa FDI drops one-third in 2025 despite Egypt’s resilience as top host: UNCTAD,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/24/africa-fdi-drops-one-third-in-2025-despite-egypts-resilience-as-top-host-unctad/,"Global foreign direct investment (FDI) rose 14% to an estimated $1.6trn in 2025, though growth was concentrated in developed economies while Africa saw inflows plummet by approximately one-third.
Egypt maintained its position as the largest FDI host on the African continent, attracting $11bn in inflows. This performance comes despite a broader continental downturn that reflected a return to prior levels following inflated figures in 2024 caused by a single large-scale project.
African Regional Trends
FDI flows to Africa were marked by significant volatility and regional disparities. Egypt’s $11bn in inflows led the continent. Greenfield project announcements in Egypt and Côte d’Ivoire contributed to a 5% rise in the total number of projects across Africa, reaching 639.
Meanwhile, inflows to Angola reached an estimated $3bn, marking a return to positive values after nine consecutive years of net divestments. Conversely, South Africa recorded negative inflows of $6bn following a $7.2bn divestment by Anglo American PLC from Valterra Platinum Ltd.
Mozambique recorded an 80% surge in inflows to $6bn, driven by the acceleration of construction on major liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.
Sectoral Shifts and Strategic Tech The global investment landscape in 2025 was increasingly shaped by data centres and artificial intelligence, a trend that posed challenges for lower-income countries.
Global Trends
The data centres sector accounted for one-fifth of global greenfield project values, surpassing $270bn. While the bulk of this was in developed markets, emerging economies like Egypt, South Africa, and Morocco are seeing increased concentration in technology-intensive sectors.
On the other hand, international project finance for infrastructure continued a four-year decline, falling 16% in value. The boom in renewable energy projects appeared to “run out of steam,” with global values in this sector dropping by 28%.
The 14% global increase was heavily influenced by more than $140bn in flows through major financial centres, including the United Kingdom and Luxembourg. In developed economies, FDI rose 43% to $728bn. In contrast, flows to developing economies declined by 2% to $877bn.
Three-quarters of the least developed countries (LDCs) saw stagnant or declining inflows. UNCTAD noted that lower-income countries continue to face persistent challenges related to financing constraints, elevated risk perceptions, and structural vulnerabilities.
2026 Outlook UNCTAD reports that prospects for 2026 remain highly uncertain. While easing inflation and lower borrowing costs could support a recovery in financing conditions, real project activity is expected to be weighed down by geopolitical tensions, regional conflicts, and economic fragmentation.

The meetings, held on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, focused on strengthening economic cooperation with international partners and highlighting the government’s reform agenda aimed at improving the investment climate and enhancing Egypt’s competitiveness.
During a meeting with Uber’s Global Chief Operating Officer Andrew Macdonald, El Khatib discussed the company’s operations in Egypt and its expansion plans in smart transportation and technology. He stressed that Egypt represents one of Uber’s key markets in the region, citing strong demand and a broad user base, particularly in Greater Cairo.
El Khatib highlighted Uber’s role in supporting the smart transport ecosystem, creating income opportunities for thousands of drivers, and generating direct employment through its customer service centres. He noted that the government places particular emphasis on improving the business environment for technology companies and digital platforms, ensuring regulatory balance and long-term investment sustainability to support sectoral growth and increase its contribution to the national economy.
The minister also pointed to the significant opportunities offered by the tourism sector for smart transport companies, within the framework of Egypt’s strategy to double tourist arrivals by 2030. He stressed that developing dedicated transport services at airports and tourist destinations, improving service quality, and responding to user feedback are key to enhancing the tourist experience, maintaining market confidence, boosting Egypt’s competitiveness as a destination, and ensuring investment sustainability.
For their part, Uber officials outlined the scale of the company’s operations in Egypt, noting that it supports around 150,000 drivers and serves nearly two million users per month. They also highlighted the operation of a regional customer service centre employing around 400 Egyptian staff serving Europe, the Middle East and Africa, alongside plans for further expansion and increased investment. The officials reaffirmed Uber’s interest in strengthening its role in the tourism sector through services tailored to tourists and its commitment to cooperating with the government to improve service quality and increase its contribution to the Egyptian economy.
El Khatib also met with Olayan Group Chief Operating Officer Saleh Merghany to discuss current and future investment opportunities in Egypt and review the group’s strategy for developing its business locally and regionally.
The minister emphasised Egypt’s strong support for foreign investment, stressing that the government provides full backing to ensure a smooth and productive investment journey. He highlighted the promising growth opportunities in the Egyptian market, noting that a focus on well-governed and transparent companies is key to achieving successful and sustainable investments.
Merghany said Egypt serves as a business incubator for the group, enabling it to develop companies locally before expanding them internationally. He noted that Olayan Group is seeking to expand its investments in several promising sectors, including food, energy and healthcare.
In the same context, El Khatib met with UPL Group Chairman and CEO Jai Shroff to discuss the Indian company’s activities and investments in Egypt, as well as opportunities for joint cooperation.
The meeting reviewed UPL’s long-standing presence in the Egyptian market, particularly in the agricultural sector, where it works with major clients. The company owns agricultural projects and ports, operates diversified import capabilities, and is active in the seed sector. It also develops advanced technologies for coating citrus fruits and mangoes to preserve quality during export, in addition to managing farm processing and packaging facilities.
During the meeting, El Khatib outlined Egypt’s national strategy, led by President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, to achieve food security. He noted that cultivated land has increased from six million feddans prior to the president’s tenure to nine million feddans, with plans to add a further 4.5 million feddans in the coming period.
He explained that the state is working to transfer the management of major agricultural projects to the private sector under sound governance frameworks to improve efficiency and achieve targeted outcomes.
El Khatib also stressed the importance of benefiting from India’s experience in digital financial inclusion, particularly through the national digital ID system, which facilitates access to services and digital payments and enables informal workers to conduct transactions. He said this supports economic formalisation, enhances transparency, and offers an effective mechanism for delivering cash assistance, with significant potential to improve overall economic governance.
The minister noted that Egypt’s population stands at around 110 million, providing a large base for economic growth and development. He added that 60% of the population is under the age of 30, reflecting strong youth potential, while around 30 million people are engaged in education—factors that support investment in agricultural and technology sectors and underpin sustainable development.
In conclusion, El Khatib reaffirmed Egypt’s commitment to continued cooperation with investors to further enhance the business environment and position the country as a platform for launching new projects at both the local and regional levels, in line with the state’s development objectives and global competitiveness.",826,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8479824662208557,2026-01-25T09:25:28.522834

The new product aligns with the state’s development priorities, the Central Bank of Egypt’s policies, Egypt Vision 2030, and national initiatives to support small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs).
Targeting doctors across all specialisations nationwide, the product caters to both early-career physicians and those seeking to expand existing clinics, establish medical centres, or upgrade medical facilities. This initiative reinforces the United Bank’s role as a developmental, economic and social partner committed to improving the quality and sustainability of the healthcare sector.
The Doctors’ Financing Product offers flexible and competitive financing solutions, featuring an interest rate of 5%, repayment periods of up to seven years, and simplified procedures tailored to the nature of medical practice and its operational and investment requirements. It enables medical professionals managing establishments of varying sizes to engage in long-term financial planning, in line with state and Central Bank initiatives aimed at achieving comprehensive development.
According to official statistics, the total number of doctors working in the public and private sectors reached approximately 212,835 in 2024, including around 82,000 in the public sector—equivalent to nine doctors per 10,000 citizens. This remains well below the global average of 23 doctors per 10,000 citizens. More than 60% of Egyptian doctors are also reported to be working abroad. Against this backdrop, The United Bank has moved to help narrow this gap and improve efficiency in addressing the challenges facing this vital sector.
Tarek Fayed, CEO and Managing Director of the United Bank, said the launch of the Doctors’ Financing Product comes at a critical time, as the state and the Central Bank of Egypt intensify efforts to support small and medium-sized enterprises, which he described as a cornerstone of economic growth.
Fayed stressed that investing in medical professionals and healthcare facilities is a direct investment in the health of Egyptian citizens and the quality of medical services, particularly in underserved and remote areas.
He added that the United Bank’s strategy focuses on supporting vital sectors—foremost among them healthcare—through specialised financing frameworks that enhance medical performance and raise service standards.
Meanwhile, Amr Nasseer, Deputy Managing Director, said the new product helps address financing challenges faced by medical establishments of all sizes, especially in relation to upgrading medical equipment.
He noted that the bank continues to offer integrated financing and digital solutions, including corporate and retail digital banking services, microfinance, technical support, and financing for innovation and entrepreneurship, in a manner that supports financial inclusion and sustainable development.",450,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7272846102714539,2026-01-25T09:25:40.514215

This performance reflects the strength of the bank’s financial position and its balanced strategy to support the national economy through financing major projects across a wide range of productive and service sectors.
Soha El-Turky, Deputy CEO of the bank, said NBE’s corporate finance and syndicated loans portfolio reached around EGP 4.8trn in 2025, representing growth of nearly 18% compared to 2024. This expansion further strengthened the bank’s market share, which stands at around 48% of Egypt’s total banking credit market.
She explained that the portfolio was distributed between EGP 4.04trn in direct financing, including medium- and long-term loans and working capital credit facilities, and EGP 754bn in indirect financing, covering letters of credit and letters of guarantee.
The total number of large corporate clients reached around 1,578 active clients, in addition to 360 credit cases currently under review and 45 cases at the final approval stage, with a combined value of nearly EGP 150bn.
Syndicated loans
El-Turky added that the National Bank of Egypt remains the largest bank financing syndicated loans in the Egyptian banking market. During 2025, the bank arranged more than 33 syndicated financing transactions with a total value exceeding EGP 442bn, while NBE’s share amounted to around EGP 205bn of the overall financing.
This included 23 transactions in which the National Bank of Egypt acted as facility agent, in addition to its roles as lead arranger, bookrunner and documentation bank.
Among the most prominent deals arranged by NBE were financing transactions for the Egyptian Bioethanol Company, El Sewedy University of Technology, the Egyptian Company for Solid Waste Recycling, Puridive, Orange Egypt, the Egyptian Emirati for Touristic Development Company, Drive Finance, Inertia Egypt, Mashareq Real Estate Developments, and Sky Innovo.
In addition, the bank served as financial adviser on a number of strategic projects, most notably the Silicon Metal Production and Derivatives Complex, launched by Alamein for Silicon Products Company, and contributed to arranging securitisation bond and sukuk issuances for several clients. The National Bank of Egypt participated in 23 issuances with a total value of EGP 70bn, with the bank’s share amounting to EGP 14bn.
The bank also succeeded in restructuring a number of syndicated loans in cooperation with local and international banks, contributing to improving financing structures and reducing borrowing costs for Egyptian companies.
Soha El-Turky
Economic and social development
El-Turky confirmed that the National Bank of Egypt continues to play its role as a key driver of economic and social development in Egypt, stemming from its commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and Egypt Vision 2030 through the expansion of green and sustainable project financing. Financing directed towards environmental and social projects reached approximately EGP 428.8bn by end-September 2025.
These financings covered projects in solar energy, water treatment, sustainable transport and green buildings, in addition to supporting industrial companies in transitioning towards low-carbon-emission production systems.
The National Bank of Egypt also places particular emphasis on financing productive sectors that create jobs and generate added value for the economy. The contracting and real estate development sector accounted for the largest share of financing in 2025, at around EGP 30bn, followed by the transport sector at EGP 28bn, then the manufacturing industries sector, and the electricity and renewable energy sector.
The bank’s portfolio of financing directed to the tourism sector reached around EGP 6bn, within the framework of the Central Bank of Egypt’s initiative to modernise hotel facilities and develop tourist destinations.
In addition, the bank is currently reviewing new financing worth EGP 150bn, which is undergoing assessment and study, focused on the petroleum, petrochemicals, glass, aluminium, transport and food industries.
Social sustainability projects
Sherif Riad, Executive Head of Large Corporate Financing at the National Bank of Egypt, said the bank’s role also extends to supporting social sustainability projects with broad impact. These include financing initiatives of the Social Housing and Mortgage Finance Fund, plans to develop the modern transport system – including environmentally friendly modes of transport – and major regional connectivity projects such as the high-speed rail, which contribute to improving quality of life and enhancing social and economic inclusion.
Riad noted that, as part of supporting the green transition, the bank also contributes to securing external financing through a range of FI Finance Programmes, in cooperation with several international institutions. These include the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Industrial Pollution Control Programme, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the China Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Federation of Industries, the Abu Dhabi Exports Office, the French Development Agency, and the Green Growth Fund. These efforts aim to enhance the bank’s capacity to finance green projects and support companies in shifting towards low-emission production systems.
Sustainable finance
The National Bank of Egypt is targeting annual growth of 10% in its sustainable finance portfolio through 2027, reflecting its firm commitment to supporting green transition projects, strengthening the resilience of the Egyptian economy, and building a more sustainable future for coming generations.
Riad confirmed that NBE is the first bank in Egypt to provide electronic services supporting the digital transformation of large corporate financing through two main pillars. The first is the internal pillar, which focuses on improving the time required to issue credit approvals, reflected in overall performance and client service through the application of a fully automated mechanism to manage credit approvals, workforce processes and sales teams, including the implementation of a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system.
The second is the external pillar, which involves direct engagement with clients through the introduction of a new mechanism based on artificial intelligence to receive and assess financing requests or propose new financing options by analysing client transactions and identifying suitable offerings, thereby significantly reducing time and effort.
Sherif Riad
Internet and mobile banking
The corporate banking sector has also focused on expanding internet and mobile banking services for large companies, with continuous updates to provide a full range of premium services. These include trade finance, cash management, government payments, bulk payments, treasury and foreign exchange services, receivables and payables reports, SWIFT services and account statements.
This is complemented by equipping staff with the necessary technology and tools to verify and complete customer data and documentation required to open accounts, update details or obtain signatures in a fully automated and immediate manner. This is in addition to applying programmes that facilitate and automate procedures, such as I-Score, the commercial register, and Moody’s.
Financing national projects
The National Bank of Egypt continues to play its leading role as the largest national bank financing major national projects, directing its resources towards supporting sustainable and productive investment while maintaining asset quality and strong liquidity ratios.
The bank provides the necessary financing to various sectors as a strategic partner in these projects, in pursuit of sustaining its role in supporting both public and private sector initiatives with sound creditworthiness and economic feasibility, positively reflected in overall economic performance.
This is demonstrated through the bank’s participation in extending financing to the National Egyptian Railway Industries Company, contributing to funding part of the investment costs of establishing a factory in the East Port Said industrial zone. The facility will serve as a fully equipped industrial platform to meet the Ministry of Transport’s expansion needs for manufacturing railway carriages for local and regional markets, representing the first project of its kind in Egypt aimed at localising railway carriage production.
The bank also participated in a long-term syndicated financing for the Social Housing Fund and mortgage finance support for projects implemented under the “Housing for All Egyptians” initiative, in line with the President’s directives.
Over the next three years, the National Bank of Egypt is targeting raising its project finance portfolio to EGP 6trn, reaffirming its role as a key engine of economic and social development in Egypt.
Awards from international institutions
Riad confirmed that the National Bank of Egypt’s strong performance in corporate financing and syndicated loans has been reflected in the bank receiving numerous awards from leading international institutions, including EMEA Finance, Global Banking & Finance Awards, and African Banker Awards.
As part of NBE’s continued progress in sustainable finance, the bank achieved a new milestone in 2025 by winning 10 prestigious regional and international awards from global institutions in recognition of its efforts to strengthen sustainability principles and environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. The awards also recognise the bank’s prominent role in financing sustainable banking transactions, environmental initiatives, and best practices in managing green finance.
These achievements reflect the National Bank of Egypt’s leading position at both regional and international levels and confirm its success in developing innovative financing solutions that support the green transition and contribute to achieving sustainable development goals.",1479,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8842329382896423,2026-01-25T09:26:54.984858
2026-01-25,Gold prices surge EGP 580 in one week as supply tightens,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/25/gold-prices-surge-egp-580-in-one-week-as-supply-tightens/,"Gold prices in Egypt’s local market rose by around EGP 580, or 9.4%, during last week’s trading, driven by a sharp rally in global bullion prices, which climbed by about $392, or 8.5%—the strongest weekly gain in nearly six years. The surge came amid rising demand, escalating geopolitical tensions, and heightened political uncertainty worldwide, according to a report by iSagha, the online gold and jewellery trading platform.
Saeed Embabi, CEO of iSagha, said gold opened the week at EGP 6,155 per gram and closed at EGP 6,735, while the global ounce price jumped from $4,596 to $4,988.
He added that 24-carat gold ended the week at EGP 7,697 per gram, while 18-carat gold reached EGP 5,773 per gram. The price of the gold pound climbed to around EGP 53,880.
Embabi noted that gold prices have risen by EGP 905 since the beginning of the year, representing a growth rate of 15.5%, broadly in line with gains in global bullion prices, which have increased by more than $670 year-to-date.
He said the local market is facing a severe shortage of gold and silver bullion due to a sharp increase in demand, particularly amid the continued suspension of imports for companies. As a result, the market is now largely dependent on resale operations, which have increasingly been directed towards exports in recent months, leading to a noticeable decline in domestic supply.
This shortage has forced manufacturers to rely on traders’ gold stocks, extending delivery periods to as long as two weeks, Embabi said.
He advised consumers to consider gold jewellery not only for adornment but also as a savings instrument, which could help ease pressure on bullion supplies. He also stressed the importance of choosing jewellery with reasonable workmanship costs that could be offset by potential price gains in the coming period.
Embabi attributed the sharp rise in local gold prices primarily to the surge in global prices, alongside relative stability in the local US dollar exchange rate and stronger domestic demand. These factors have contributed to widening the gap between local and global prices to around EGP 146.
Globally, gold posted strong gains last week as investors flocked to safe-haven assets amid persistent geopolitical and economic uncertainty, as well as weakness in the US dollar.
Analysts say US President Donald Trump’s trade policies, particularly his repeated use of tariffs as a political pressure tool, have undermined investor confidence in US assets, raising concerns over the dollar and boosting demand for gold.
Although tensions eased somewhat midweek after Trump announced he would step back from earlier threats to impose tariffs on European countries following the outline of a future framework agreement on Greenland, the lack of binding details limited the impact on gold prices.
Investors remain cautious, with doubts over the ability to fully contain global tensions keeping demand for the precious metal elevated.
On the monetary policy front, recent economic data have reinforced expectations that interest rates will remain unchanged at the US Federal Reserve’s meeting on 27–28 January, with the current policy stance likely to continue throughout the first quarter.
Trump also announced the conclusion of interviews to select the next Federal Reserve Chair, with a decision expected before the end of January. Concerns persist that a new appointment could pave the way for a more accommodative monetary policy, given Trump’s repeated criticism of current Chair Jerome Powell over the pace of rate cuts.
Meanwhile, data from the University of Michigan’s January survey showed improved consumer sentiment, with the Consumer Expectations Index rising to 57 from 55, while the Consumer Sentiment Index increased to 56.4 from 54.
One-year inflation expectations declined to 4% from 4.2%, while five-year expectations eased to 3.3% from 3.4%. Core personal consumption expenditures inflation remained steady at 2.9%, while initial jobless claims rose to 200,000.
The precious metals sector continues to show strong momentum at the start of the year, with silver prices surpassing $100 per ounce and gold approaching the $5,000 mark. Despite some signs of overbought conditions, analysts maintain that the rally is supported by solid fundamentals.
As gold nears the $5,000 per ounce threshold, Bank of America has raised its short-term price target to $6,000, making it the most bullish among major financial institutions.
Global markets are now awaiting a series of key economic indicators in the coming week, including US durable goods data, consumer confidence figures, weekly jobless claims, and the producer price index.
Investor attention will also focus on monetary policy decisions by the Bank of Canada and the US Federal Reserve, given their direct impact on the US dollar and precious metals prices, particularly gold.",765,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8844485282897949,2026-01-27T09:35:36.183141
2026-01-26,Egypt-Switzerland trade exchange hits $2.3bn in 2025: El-Khatib,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/26/egypt-switzerland-trade-exchange-hits-2-3bn-in-2025-el-khatib/,"Hassan El-Khatib, Minister of Investment and Foreign Trade, took part in the Egyptian-Swiss Economic Forum organised by the Swiss Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, underscoring the depth and momentum of economic relations between the two countries.
The forum was attended by Khaled Abdel Ghaffar, Deputy Prime Minister for Human Development and Minister of Health and Population; Ashraf Naguib, Co-Founder and CEO of Global Trade Matters; Andreas Baum, Switzerland’s Ambassador to Cairo; Helene Budliger Artieda, Swiss State Secretary for Economic Affairs; and Kamal Abdel Malek, Chairperson of the Swiss Chamber of Commerce in Egypt.
El-Khatib described the Egypt-Switzerland partnership as a distinguished model of bilateral cooperation, citing the diversity and strength of relations across precision industries, pharmaceuticals and heavy industry. He noted that the partnership reflects strong complementarity between the two countries’ industrial and technological capabilities.
He added that as European countries seek to enhance competitiveness and reorganise global supply chains, they increasingly require geographically closer and more flexible partners. In this context, El-Khatib said Egypt is a pivotal partner due to its strategic location and expanding productive capacity.
Trade relations between Egypt and Switzerland are gaining tangible momentum, the minister said, noting that bilateral trade exchange reached approximately $2.3bn last year, recording a surplus in Egypt’s favour. This, he explained, reflects the robustness of economic ties between the two countries.
El-Khatib highlighted that more than 100 Swiss companies currently operate in the Egyptian market across advanced industrial and technological sectors, serving as efficient production and export platforms. This presence, he said, reflects growing confidence in the Egyptian economy and opens the door to deeper partnerships, including local manufacturing and technology transfer.
The minister pointed to substantial state investments in infrastructure over recent years, including road networks, ports and energy projects, alongside the establishment of more than 22 new cities. He stressed that full coordination between the Cabinet and relevant ministries has helped create a supportive economic environment in which the private sector leads development efforts.
He noted that infrastructure investments over the past decade have laid the groundwork for a more sustainable economic take-off, while an integrated package of economic reforms launched around a year and a half ago has focused on enhancing competitiveness and improving the business climate.
On monetary policy, El-Khatib said the government adopted an approach prioritising inflation reduction rather than exchange-rate targeting. This contributed to lowering inflation from nearly 40% to about 12.3% over 18 months, with the Central Bank projecting inflation of between 7% and 9%.
He added that other indicators demonstrate the success of the reform programme, as foreign assets increased from around $18bn to nearly $30bn, while international reserves exceeded $51bn.
Fiscal policy has also undergone a qualitative shift, El-Khatib said, with the Ministry of Finance adopting a simplified, investor-friendly approach. Despite no tax increases, tax revenues rose by 35% in one year—the highest increase since 2005—reflecting improved efficiency and a broader tax base.
In terms of trade facilitation, El-Khatib said Egypt aims to rank among the world’s top 50 countries in trade competitiveness by reducing customs clearance time and costs. Within a single year, clearance time and costs were cut by 65%, generating direct savings of around $1.5bn and boosting the competitiveness of Egyptian exports.
He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to removing non-tariff barriers in cooperation with the European Union and international partners, and to opening a new chapter in investment relations. He added that Egypt recorded its lowest trade balance deficit since 2010 this year, while stressing the importance of completing deeper structural reforms to sustain growth.
Digitalisation, El-Khatib said, is a central pillar of the next phase, offering the fastest path to enhanced competitiveness. Over the past year and a half, a digital platform has been launched to provide licensing, fee payment and government services.
He explained that parliament has approved the establishment of a comprehensive “economic platform” that will cover all company incorporation services, supported by re-engineered procedures to reduce time and cost. The platform is expected to be fully implemented within 12 to 18 months and will integrate trade and investment services, linking the General Authority for Investment with other government entities.
El-Khatib also highlighted Egypt’s strategic geographic location, advanced infrastructure and extensive road network, alongside a wide network of free trade agreements with the European Union, Africa, the United States and Latin America.
He said Egypt enjoys a strong cost advantage, ranking among the lowest-cost production locations across the region spanning Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and pointed to the country’s significant solar energy potential, particularly in the Western Desert.
The minister added that Egypt aims to become a regional hub for the production and export of green energy and environmentally friendly products, as well as a net exporter of electricity, in line with the global transition to a green economy.
Concluding his remarks, El-Khatib emphasised that human capital remains Egypt’s most valuable asset. He noted that the education system includes around 25 million pre-university students and about 5 million university students, forming a base of 30 million young people driving future economic and technological growth. He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to deepening cooperation with Swiss companies through investment, technology transfer and job creation, and to providing a stable, transparent and attractive investment environment.",868,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9119855165481568,2026-01-27T09:35:38.931180
2026-01-25,"EBA explores future of fractional real estate investment, digital platforms",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/25/eba-explores-future-of-fractional-real-estate-investment-digital-platforms/,"Fathallah Fawzy, Chairperson of the Real Estate Development and Contracting Committee at the Egyptian Businessmen’s Association (EBA), said that moving towards fractional property ownership through digital platforms and real estate investment funds (REIFs) represents an important step in developing modern financial mechanisms that support the national economy.
Speaking during a committee meeting, participants described these tools as a qualitative shift that transforms real estate into a regulated financial product subject to governance and regulatory oversight.
Fawzy noted that fractional real estate investment via digital platforms has become one of the most prominent modern investment tools, particularly in light of the sharp rise in property prices, which has exceeded the financial capacity of large segments of individuals. This trend, he said, has driven growing demand for partial real estate ownership.
He added that the Egyptian market has witnessed the launch of more than five digital real estate platforms within a single year, reflecting a tangible shift in investor behaviour. Fawzy stressed that real estate investment funds represent a key pillar for the growth and sustainability of the real estate development sector.
Fawzy also called for studying Saudi Arabia’s experience in establishing real estate funds dedicated to developing specific projects for defined timeframes, followed by clear exit strategies and profit distribution. Such mechanisms, he said, provide liquidity for developers and help reduce project delivery delays.
He noted that while this model has not yet been fully activated in Egypt, developers have held several meetings with the Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA), which has introduced strict regulatory frameworks for digital platforms to ensure they promote structured investment rather than unauthorised fund collection. He emphasised that clear exit mechanisms are the main distinction between legitimate investment activity and illegal practices.
For his part, Ahmed Abu El-Saad, a real estate fund management expert, portfolio manager, and CEO of Azimut Egypt, delivered a detailed presentation on the evolution of Egypt’s digital real estate platforms and REIFs. He highlighted recent legislative developments and tax exemptions applicable to both fund managers and certificate holders.
Abu El-Saad said that fractional investment has become a core savings tool for individuals and an effective hedge against inflation and currency volatility amid ongoing global economic uncertainty.
He revealed that there is a move towards abolishing the capital gains tax stipulated in Law No. 30, noting that the decision is in its final stages and is expected to provide a strong boost to the investment market and REIFs.
Abu El-Saad added that one of Egypt’s largest real estate investment funds is scheduled for official launch next month, starting with initial investments of EGP 200m and a plan to gradually increase capital to EGP 2bn.
He explained that the fund will operate through multiple issuances, with each issuance targeting a specific sector, including income-generating administrative buildings and hospitality assets such as hotels and hotel rooms, alongside other investment models currently under study. Subscriptions will start from EGP 5,000, reinforcing the principle of democratising investment and enabling broader public participation in the real estate market.
Abu El-Saad also noted that Misr for Central Clearing, Depository and Registry (MCDR) will act as custodian for the fund’s certificates, ensuring ease of ownership transfer and enhanced liquidity—an advantage over traditional real estate investment.
He stressed the importance of obtaining FRA licensing before launching digital platforms for fractional property sales, as this enables electronic contract execution and links investors directly to regulated funds, helping provide the liquidity needed to finance a wide range of real estate projects.",577,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.6963874697685242,2026-01-27T09:36:11.326632

The transaction, which remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, marks the first exit for Admaius Capital Partners’ current fund. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Parkville, founded in 2008 and headquartered in Cairo, operates across the pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, and nutraceutical sectors. The company’s portfolio includes skincare, haircare, and therapeutic lines, which it develops, manufactures, and distributes within the Egyptian market and for export.
Admaius invested in Parkville alongside its founders, Chairperson Sherif Bassiouny and CEO Mahmoud Farrag, in November 2023. Since that investment, the company has expanded its manufacturing capabilities, corporate governance, and e-commerce presence despite macroeconomic challenges in Egypt, including currency devaluations and high inflation.
“The dollar returns to our investors are very attractive and demonstrate what is possible when strong market positioning, drive and focus combine with superior execution,” said Marlon Chigwende, Admaius Managing Partner. He added that the sale underscores the fund’s performance and the firm’s ability to operate in complex environments.
Ahmed Rady, Managing Director at Admaius, said the firm’s work in Egypt focused on strengthening operations and scalability through a “hands-on, partnership-driven approach.”

The authority said its regulatory decisions have evolved into effective empowerment tools, contributing to stronger economic growth and deeper financial markets.
Mohamed Farid, Chairperson of the FRA, said 2025 represented a genuine turning point in beginning to reap the fruits of the authority’s reform policies implemented since 2022. He stressed that there is no “magic wand” in the reform process, noting that sustainable development is cumulative and requires a clear vision, disciplined execution, and continuous engagement with market participants.
Farid said technology has become the common denominator in developing all non-banking financial sectors, explaining that the FRA has treated digital transformation as a core empowerment tool rather than a procedural upgrade. He emphasised that development and modernisation are reflected in tangible improvements in market efficiency and in citizens’ and companies’ ability to access financial services with greater ease.
He added that, in preparing and updating regulatory frameworks, the authority was keen to listen closely to the market, noting that decisions related to modernisation and development were the result of extensive dialogue with companies and institutions operating across the sector. This approach, he said, ensures a balance between encouraging innovation, protecting users’ rights, and safeguarding market stability.
Farid said the FRA has institutionalised innovation through the launch of its regulatory sandbox, which serves as a structured platform to receive, nurture, test and develop new ideas within a secure supervisory environment before their full market rollout.
These efforts have led to the creation of an integrated financial technology ecosystem comprising 73 fintech companies, including 45 already operating and 28 completing licensing procedures, under a flexible supervisory model aligned with global developments.
He noted that digital identity verification tools (E-KYC) have become a practical reality, with around 354,000 digital verification operations carried out during 2025. Males accounted for 85% of these operations, compared to 15% for females. Of the total, 63% related to financing activities, 28% to capital market transactions, and 9% to the insurance sector.
Digital transformation also supported the signing of around 189,000 digital contracts during the year, including 122,000 in the capital market and 67,000 across various financing activities. Farid said this significantly reduced the time and cost of accessing financial services while expanding the beneficiary base.
Farid noted that Egypt’s capital market recorded a historic surge in 2025, with total trading value reaching EGP 15.7trn, compared to around EGP 2.3trn in 2024. Treasury bill and bond trading accounted for EGP 13.1trn, while equity trading reached EGP 2.4trn.
He added that the market welcomed 299,000 new investors over the year, reflecting growing confidence driven by the authority’s regulatory and reform measures.
Farid said the FRA continued to develop listing rules and introduce new financial products, including the activation of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs), such as Catalyst Partners Middle East with capital of EGP 3bn and Hassan Allam Investment. He also highlighted the execution of Egypt’s first reverse acquisition, through which Egytrans acquired NOSCO, increasing its capital to EGP 224.9m, as well as the listing of ValU via a parent-company dividend distribution mechanism.
He said the authority placed particular emphasis on protecting investors’ rights, citing updated voluntary delisting rules designed to ensure fairness and safeguard minority shareholders, including the case of Ezz Steel, which resulted in hundreds of millions of pounds being returned to shareholders.
Farid noted that gold investment funds attracted around 324,000 investors, with total investments reaching EGP 5.145bn in 2025. He also pointed to the launch of Egypt’s first organised voluntary carbon market to support sustainability efforts and reduce carbon emissions.
He added that the FRA granted the Egyptian Exchange its first licence to trade futures contracts, strengthening hedging tools and risk management mechanisms within the capital market.
Non-banking financing sectors continued to play a developmental role in 2025, Farid said. Medium, small and microenterprise finance injected around EGP 105.3bn, serving 4.2 million beneficiaries. Leasing activity reached EGP 147.2bn, mortgage finance totalled EGP 24.3bn, posting growth of 51.9%, while consumer finance recorded EGP 61.3bn and factoring reached EGP 64.9bn.
Farid said 2025 also marked a strong launch for real estate crowdfunding as an innovative investment solution. The authority received 32 applications from entities seeking to enter the market, including 21 companies applying for licences to practise the activity and 11 companies involved in promoting and underwriting real estate investment funds.
Regulatory efforts have so far resulted in approvals for five companies, three of which have obtained full licences. One company has already launched Egypt’s first official digital platform allowing citizens to invest digitally in fractional real estate ownership. Farid said the initiative aims to broaden ownership and provide safe, organised investment alternatives suitable for all segments of society.
He added that the insurance sector recorded a notable leap in 2025, with total premiums rising to EGP 110.1bn, up 30.6%. This included EGP 61.9bn in life insurance and EGP 48.2bn in property insurance, while claims paid reached EGP 46.7bn.
Farid also noted that the activation of the movable collateral registry enabled the registration of assets worth EGP 3.2trn through 145,000 registrations, improving companies’ access to financing.
He said 2025 also saw the launch of the financial derivatives market as a major step in developing Egypt’s capital market, with the FRA issuing a comprehensive regulatory framework governing the trading of derivatives, futures and options in line with international best practice.
Farid concluded that the 2025 results reflect the FRA’s success in building a more efficient and competitive non-banking financial market, grounded in digital transformation, market engagement, institutionalised innovation and strong stakeholder protection, in support of sustainable economic growth.",948,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.5950648784637451,2026-01-27T09:36:36.773325

The CBE said the repayments included $1.895bn in interest payments and $6.749bn in principal instalments, compared with total repayments of $8.784bn in the third quarter (Q3) of the same fiscal year.
Egypt’s external debt rose to $161.23bn in June 2025, up from $156.689bn in March 2025. The external debt-to-GDP ratio increased to about 44.2%, compared with 43% in the previous period.
According to the report, Egypt paid a total of $38.736bn in external debt service—principal and interest—during FY 2024/2025. This included $7.952bn in the first quarter, $13.354bn in the second quarter, $8.784bn in Q3, and approximately $8.645bn in Q4.
In a related development, the CBE revealed that net foreign assets (NFA) in Egypt’s banking sector increased by EGP 128.5bn during July and August 2025, representing a growth rate of 17.3%.
The rise was driven by an increase of EGP 110.9bn in net foreign assets at commercial banks, alongside a rise of EGP 17.6bn at the Central Bank of Egypt.
The CBE also reported that net domestic assets in the banking sector rose by around EGP 186.7bn during the same two-month period, reflecting a growth rate of 1.5%. This increase was primarily due to a rise in domestic credit of about EGP 659.6bn, or 4.4%, partially offset by a decline of around EGP 472.9bn in net budgetary items.
Domestic credit growth was driven by higher net claims on the government, which rose by EGP 49.6bn, alongside increased lending to the private business sector by EGP 72.5bn, the public business sector by EGP 74bn, and the household sector by approximately EGP 60.5bn.",289,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9445696473121644,2026-01-27T09:36:51.428560

The move reflects the bank’s ongoing efforts to integrate climate considerations across its operations and underscores its commitment to environmental sustainability, in line with the direction of the Egyptian government and the Central Bank of Egypt towards a greener, low-carbon economy.
By adopting PCAF methodologies, Suez Canal Bank will be able to identify carbon-intensive sectors within its financing portfolio, enhance credit and portfolio risk assessments, and strengthen its capacity to design green and transition finance solutions tailored to clients’ needs.
The membership marks a significant milestone in the bank’s efforts to align with international best practice in environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure, comply with evolving regulatory requirements, and unlock new opportunities to attract climate-aligned investment.
Commenting on the development, Akef El Maghraby, CEO and Managing Director of Suez Canal Bank, said the bank has already taken proactive steps to measure emissions associated with its financing activities. He added that joining PCAF represents a key step in embedding sustainability within the bank’s business model and reinforces its commitment to adopting unified international methodologies that enhance transparency and support the expansion of green finance, in line with Egypt’s National Climate Change Strategy and Egypt Vision 2030.
For her part, Angélica Afanador, Executive Director of the PCAF Secretariat, welcomed Suez Canal Bank’s accession to the partnership, describing it as an important step towards advancing sustainable finance in Egypt. She noted that by committing to measuring and reporting emissions linked to financial activities, the bank is enhancing transparency in the region and taking concrete steps towards effective emissions management.",297,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.858883261680603,2026-01-27T09:37:38.057855
2026-01-25,Polaris Parks expands footprint in Sadat City with 1.1 million sqm land acquisition,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/25/polaris-parks-expands-footprint-in-sadat-city-with-1-1-million-sqm-land-acquisition/,"Polaris Parks for Industrial Development, a leading developer of industrial parks in Egypt, has announced the acquisition of a new 1.1 million square metre land plot in a strategic location in Sadat City.
The expansion is expected to attract direct investments of around $1bn and generate approximately 15,000 direct and indirect job opportunities.
The acquisition represents a natural extension of the Polaris Sadat City Industrial Park, developed across an area of 1.4 million square metres and currently hosting around 100 factories.
Located about 2.5 kilometres from the existing park, the newly acquired land allows for close operational integration between the two developments. Sadat City Industrial Park has already attracted significant local and international investments, reinforcing the city’s position as a key destination for industrial investment.
The new expansion will be implemented according to a phased development timeline designed to ensure the highest efficiency standards, with full completion scheduled for January 2028. Once completed, the project will offer investors a future-ready, fully integrated industrial environment.
Commenting on the expansion, Osman Evren Arikan, Managing Director of Polaris Parks, said the acquisition marked “a new chapter in the company’s growth journey”, adding that Polaris Parks focuses on developing integrated industrial communities that support long-term investment and generate real economic value, rather than simply providing serviced land.
Meanwhile, Basil Shaira, General Manager of Polaris Parks, said the new acquisition directly addresses growing demand from industrial investors for well-planned developments built on clear standards. He noted that such projects enhance investment readiness, improve operational efficiency, and support manufacturers’ sustainable growth strategies.
With nearly two decades of experience, Polaris Parks has developed a diversified portfolio of industrial projects across four key regions in Egypt. These include its flagship Polaris International Industrial Park and Polaris Zamil Industrial Park in 6th of October City, Polaris Sadat City Industrial Park, and Polaris New October in New October City.
Collectively, the company’s developments span more than 10 million square metres and host over 600 factories, in addition to around 450 units dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises.
Polaris Parks’ projects have attracted cumulative investments exceeding $3.5bn and generated more than 85,000 direct and indirect job opportunities, underlining the industrial sector’s role as a key driver of economic growth.
The latest expansion aligns with national efforts to deepen industrial activity, enhance the competitiveness of local production, and create sustainable employment opportunities, in line with Egypt’s plans to increase the industrial sector’s contribution to the national economy by 2030.
Polaris Parks is among the first companies to introduce the private industrial parks model in Egypt. Since 2007, it has been developing integrated industrial communities based on long-term planning and sustainable infrastructure, strengthening investment readiness and supporting the sector’s long-term growth.",448,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8241174221038818,2026-01-27T09:37:43.319861
2026-01-25,Housing Minister moves to boost hospitality investment,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/25/housing-minister-moves-to-boost-hospitality-investment/,"Minister of Housing, Utilities and Urban Communities Sherif El-Sherbiny chaired a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Tourism Development Authority (TDA) to review ongoing work, assess the status of tourism development projects, and discuss measures to accelerate tourism investment.
During the meeting, the board approved a package of measures aimed at supporting tourism development. These include rescheduling instalment payments for tourism development and investment companies, without affecting the timelines of subsequent payments, within the framework of previously approved facilitation measures.
The board also approved extending the grace period granted to tourism development and investment companies that have obtained preliminary approvals and remain compliant with their financial obligations. The extension allows these companies additional time to complete preliminary approval procedures and proceed with final land allocation steps.
El-Sherbiny reaffirmed the ministry’s commitment to supporting serious investors in hospitality projects and providing all necessary incentives to increase hotel room capacity, in line with the state’s strategy to strengthen tourism infrastructure.
The meeting reviewed the authority’s revenues generated between July 1, 2025 and January 2026, which reached approximately EGP 4.689bn—equivalent to 294% of targeted revenues for the same period of the current fiscal year.
The TDA is also developing updated technical regulations governing standards and requirements, aimed at enhancing the investment climate in the tourism sector.
At the conclusion of the meeting, the housing minister stressed the importance of continued coordination and intensified efforts to drive tourism investment forward and keep pace with rapid sectoral developments.
Egypt aims to increase its hotel capacity to around 500,000 rooms, up from approximately 228,000 rooms by the end of 2024. Under the tourism development plan for fiscal year 2025/2026, the government is targeting tourism investments of about EGP 116bn, representing growth of more than 60% compared with the previous year.
Real estate developers are increasingly turning to hotel projects as they seek recurring and sustainable income streams, rather than relying solely on one-off residential unit sales. Hotels offer diversified revenue—often denominated in foreign currency—helping developers hedge against exchange rate volatility.
At the same time, the licensing of residential units as serviced apartments or holiday homes has emerged as a growing trend, offering higher investment value for both developers and buyers.
Investment activity is concentrated in several key areas, led by the North Coast—particularly Ras El Hekma and its surroundings—which has evolved from a seasonal destination into a year-round tourism hub. In Greater Cairo, especially West Cairo, hotel development has accelerated around the Pyramids and the Sphinx following the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum. The Red Sea region, notably Nabq, has also attracted investor interest after the government offered large land plots for the development of luxury tourist resorts.
To support hotel development, the government has introduced a range of incentives, including a EGP 50bn financing initiative to fund hotel construction and expansion at concessional interest rates. Authorities have also allowed the conversion of residential, administrative and commercial units into hotel use—without activity-change fees in designated areas—to help address room shortages.
In parallel, sustainability has become a growing priority, with green hotels now accounting for around 37% of Egypt’s existing hotel capacity.",518,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9274340867996216,2026-01-27T09:37:48.464183

The newly introduced AI-driven solutions are designed to enhance marketing efficiency, optimise operational performance, and improve customer experience by leveraging advanced data analytics, automation tools, and intelligent customer engagement technologies.
Bold Brand said that understanding differences between regional markets is central to the success of any expansion strategy. Egypt offers a large and diverse consumer base with growing demand for digital services and e-commerce, although purchasing power remains relatively moderate, driving stronger consumer focus on value and competitive pricing.
By contrast, Saudi Arabia’s market is smaller in population but significantly higher in purchasing power, making it more receptive to premium products, high-quality services, and sophisticated digital marketing campaigns.
Consumer behaviour also differs notably between the two markets. Egyptian consumers tend to be more price-sensitive and highly responsive to promotions, while Saudi consumers place greater emphasis on brand credibility, user experience, and service quality. These distinctions require tailored marketing approaches, supported by AI tools capable of analysing behaviour, personalising content, and improving targeting accuracy.
The agency added that Saudi Arabia’s stricter regulations on digital advertising and data protection further increase the need for advanced, compliance-focused marketing solutions.
Through its AI-powered services, Bold Brand aims to help companies build strong, data-driven brands, enhance customer journeys, and deliver measurable results in both markets. The launch is positioned as a strategic response to growing regional demand for intelligent, scalable, and compliant digital marketing solutions.",273,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.6624404788017273,2026-01-27T09:37:58.462395

The project is being implemented in partnership with the private sector as part of the state’s strategy to deepen local manufacturing and strengthen public–private partnerships.
El-Shimy noted that the project is the first of its kind in Egypt, the Middle East, and Africa to establish a specialised plant for the production of chlorine tablets and granules, representing a qualitative leap in the chemical industries sector and supporting the localisation of a high value-added industry.
He stressed that the project will strengthen Egypt’s regional and international standing in the chemical industries, contribute to boosting exports, reduce the import bill, and enhance the competitiveness of Egyptian products in global markets. The initiative also aligns with Egypt Vision 2030 for sustainable development, as it supports industrial localisation and the maximisation of foreign currency resources.
The project is being implemented through Puradive Chemicals Production Company, with contributions from the Holding Company for Chemical Industries, Misr Chemical Industries Company, and private-sector partner Cadence Energy. El-Shimy highlighted this structure as a successful model for integrating public-sector expertise with private investment. Total investments in the project amount to $39m.
Once operational, the facility will have an annual production capacity of 10,000 tonnes of chlorine tablets and granules (TCCA) and 10,000 tonnes of cyanuric acid, which are used in swimming pool disinfection, water treatment, sterilisation, and various industrial applications, including paper and textile processing.
In addition, the project will produce 18,000 tonnes annually of anhydrous ammonium sulphate, a high-quality agricultural fertiliser that will support the agricultural sector and strengthen domestic production.
The implementation contract has been signed with China’s Capsom, a company with extensive experience in the design and construction of chemical granules and tablets plants. Financing agreements have also been concluded with the National Bank of Egypt (NBE) and the Commercial International Bank (CIB).

Machinery and equipment led the way with a 30% increase, followed by electrical and electronic industries at 23%. Auto components and household appliances each grew by 15%, while transport equipment expanded by 14%. The metals sector recorded an exceptional surge, posting a remarkable growth rate of 273%.

Al-Wazir extended an open invitation to American firms to invest in Egypt, emphasising the availability of promising and viable investment opportunities.
Maritime transport was identified as a key area for enhanced cooperation, with Al-Wazir highlighting Egypt’s 19 commercial ports. He called on U.S. companies to participate in the management, operation, and concession of a number of port terminals, particularly international maritime terminals at the ports of Berenice, Sokhna, Safaga, Alexandria, and Gargoub.
He added that Egyptian ports have successfully attracted major global terminal operators and leading international shipping lines, and are integrated with the national high-speed electric rail network.
The Deputy Prime Minister also stressed the importance of increasing the number of U.S. manufacturing facilities in Egypt, in line with the strength of bilateral relations and the advanced technological base of American industry. He singled out new and renewable energy industries as among the most promising areas for expanded cooperation, citing Egypt’s favourable investment climate and ongoing efforts to advance industrial development.
For his part, Landau reaffirmed the strength of Egyptian-American relations and expressed strong U.S. interest in expanding economic cooperation with Egypt, particularly in light of the comprehensive development underway across multiple sectors and the successful track record of U.S.-backed projects in the country.
He noted that he had met with the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, whose members praised the close cooperation between the Egyptian government and the Chamber in promoting investment and joint economic growth.
Landau emphasised the importance of broadening collaboration in sectors including renewable energy, automotive manufacturing, aviation infrastructure, technology, and the management and operation of maritime terminals. He added that the investment opportunities presented during the meeting would be introduced to American companies to further enhance bilateral cooperation in line with the strong and strategic partnership between Egypt and the United States.",484,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9169796705245972,2026-01-28T09:37:23.953233
2026-01-27,Egypt opens EGP 3.5bn Cleopatra Sky hospital under private-public partnership model,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/27/egypt-opens-egp-3-5bn-cleopatra-sky-hospital-under-private-public-partnership-model/,"Egypt has opened the EGP 3.5bn Cleopatra Hospital Tagamoa (Sky) in East Cairo as part of a strategic shift to leverage private sector expertise in state-owned medical facilities, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said on Tuesday.
The facility, which is owned by the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources but equipped and managed by the Cleopatra Hospitals Group, represents a flagship model for the state’s public-private partnership (PPP) programme. Madbouly stated that the government is moving forward with plans to enhance healthcare services by expanding partnerships with both local and foreign private sectors to ensure financial and operational sustainability.
“The government is making great efforts to develop the health system in Egypt and reach all parts of the republic with health initiative services,” Madbouly said, adding that the state is focused on improving the efficiency of existing projects while achieving high global standards in new ones.
The opening was attended by Khaled Abdel Ghaffar, Deputy Prime Minister for Human Development and Minister of Health and Population, alongside Petroleum Minister Karim Badawi and Ahmed Ezzeldin, CEO of Cleopatra Hospitals Group.
Abdel Ghaffar noted that the Cleopatra Sky hospital employs artificial intelligence for diagnosis and treatment and uses data-driven management systems. The facility includes approximately 240 rooms, 48 intensive care beds, seven operating theatres, and two catheterisation laboratories, covering more than 40 specialised disciplines.
Before the opening, Madbouly inspected the construction of the New Heliopolis Hospital, a 400-bed project scheduled for completion by January 2027. The hospital, being built on a 42,000-square-metre site by the Ministry of Health in cooperation with the Engineering Authority of the Armed Forces, is intended to serve approximately one million residents.
Abdel Ghaffar revealed that the Ministry of Health has begun communications with Italy’s San Donato Group to discuss potential opportunities for the Italian organisation to manage and operate the Heliopolis site. He said the move follows directives from President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi to strengthen international partnerships to ensure national medical services meet global standards.
The New Heliopolis Hospital will feature 194 intensive care beds, 57 incubators for premature infants, and 16 operating rooms for general, open-heart, and neurosurgery. It will also house specialised units for bone marrow and organ transplants, as well as a 50-machine dialysis centre for adults and a 20-machine unit for children.
Petroleum Minister Karim Badawi said the partnership at the Cleopatra Sky facility aligns with the state’s vision to place human health at the forefront of development priorities. Ahmed Ezzeldin, CEO of Cleopatra Hospitals Group, added that the hospital includes specialised centres of excellence for trauma, heart disease, kidney care, and neurology.
The Cleopatra Sky facility also features a 25-bed emergency department staffed by consultants 24 hours a day, alongside integrated blood bank services and specialised paediatric environments covering 11 sub-specialities.",458,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8472787737846375,2026-01-28T09:37:33.981143

During AmCham Egypt Annual Real Estate Conference “Egypt Rising: Real Estate as a Regional Powerhouse”, on Tuesday, Ibrahim said the reform drive focuses on tightening regulation, digitising procedures, and addressing long-standing structural challenges that have hindered investor confidence and market efficiency.
Professional licensing and market standardisation
He stressed the importance of introducing strict professional licensing requirements for real estate practitioners, citing Canada’s model, where mandatory training courses are enforced and licences can be revoked in cases of violations. Similar measures, he noted, would help raise professional standards and protect investors in the Egyptian market.
Efforts are also underway to unify real estate measurement standards—particularly the distinction between net and gross areas—to ensure transparency and eliminate inconsistent reporting among developers. Ibrahim highlighted persistent discrepancies in property area measurements between developers, consultants, municipalities, and the real estate registry, describing them as a key challenge for both local and foreign investors.
To address this issue, a centralised real estate database is being developed to provide accurate and reliable data for feasibility studies. The database will be accessible online and will display property values in both Egyptian pounds and U.S. dollars.
Digital platform for real estate exports
Ibrahim revealed that a unified digital platform for real estate export is currently being rolled out in coordination with the Ministries of Communications, Justice, and Interior. The platform will link municipal authorities directly with the real estate registry, allowing non-Egyptian buyers to purchase and register properties through a streamlined and transparent process.
He also announced plans to activate the “Urban Observatory” under NUCA, which will collect and analyse urban data from new cities. The observatory is expected to serve as a key reference for investors and policymakers, supporting data-driven decision-making across the sector.
Ibrahim concluded that the combined reforms—spanning regulation, digitisation, and data standardisation—are expected to position Egypt’s real estate market as a more transparent, organised, and investor-friendly destination.",357,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.7582277655601501,2026-01-28T09:38:36.561962
2026-01-27,Opinion | Trump’s “Board of Peace”: A Private Security Council to Enforce His Global Ambitions – The Shylock of Our Time,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/27/opinion-trumps-board-of-peace-a-private-security-council-to-enforce-his-global-ambitions-the-shylock-of-our-time/,"The recently launched “Board of Peace” is, at its core, a key pillar of U.S. President Donald Trump’s strategy to end the war in Gaza and oversee the second phase of his proposed plan — encompassing the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip and the disarmament of Hamas. Just days ago, during a White House press conference, Trump publicly suggested that the Board of Peace “could” replace the United Nations.
Even without this overt statement, the council’s draft charter delivers an unusually blunt critique of existing international institutions. It argues that “lasting peace requires practical governance, logical solutions, and the courage to abandon approaches and institutions that have frequently failed.” It further calls for “a more flexible and effective international peacebuilding body,” a thinly veiled reference to the United Nations. According to the charter, the council’s mission is to “promote stability, restore credible and lawful governance, and secure sustainable peace” in conflict zones, while developing global best practices.
Under the proposed structure, Donald Trump himself would serve as President of the Board of Peace. Although the document avoids explicitly using the term “president for life,” reports from CNN and Reuters indicate that Trump is expected to retain this position even after leaving office.
This arrangement would grant the president unprecedented authority. He alone would possess veto power, control invitations to member states, expel participants, set meeting agendas, and establish or dissolve subsidiary bodies at will. Removal would only be possible through voluntary resignation or a unanimous vote by the council’s executive committee declaring him unfit — a virtually insurmountable safeguard that entrenches personal dominance over collective governance.
Dr. Hatem Sadek
Trump, who reportedly invited around 60 world leaders — nearly two-thirds of United Nations member states — to join the initiative, has approached the project with the instincts of a businessman rather than a statesman. In a striking move, he has reportedly set a price of $1bn for any country seeking a permanent seat on the council. Unsurprisingly, most governments have so far declined, citing legitimate fears that the body would undermine, marginalise, or even supplant the United Nations.
The UN, already weakened by structural paralysis and the dominance of the “Big Five,” has long struggled to act independently of major power politics. Ironically, it is the American veto itself that has contributed significantly to the erosion of the Security Council’s credibility. The proposed Board of Peace appears poised not to remedy these flaws, but to institutionalise them under a single leader’s control.
In effect, this council risks becoming Trump’s personal geopolitical instrument — designed to impose his vision, advance his ambitions, and enforce a form of political guardianship over states he deems strategically relevant. The precedent set in Venezuela, along with emerging signals regarding Greenland, suggests that this body could function as a private Security Council devoted less to international stability and more to the realisation of the American president’s personal agenda.
There appears to be little capable of restraining a leader intent on reshaping the global order. Even NATO allies now anxiously await Trump’s next move concerning the Danish island of Greenland, aware that their strongest possible response — should he resort to force — would amount to little more than cautious diplomatic condemnation. Europe today finds itself in its most precarious strategic position since the end of World War II.
Defying Trump’s wishes could weaken, or even fracture, NATO, while triggering economic retaliation in the form of sanctions, tariffs, and political pressure — as previously witnessed in U.S. relations with France. Conversely, acquiescence could leave Europe exposed to the ambitions of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has not forgotten the West’s role in drawing Ukraine into a prolonged war of attrition under the banner of NATO expansion. The gravest European fear is the convergence of Putin’s desire for revenge with Trump’s apparent ambition to abandon NATO altogether — a scenario that could leave the continent dangerously vulnerable.
The proposed Board of Peace will likely not be the last of Trump’s bold — or erratic — experiments in global power projection. With striking audacity, he continues to pursue a vision of unilateral American dominance, presenting the United States as an unassailable global force — at least in his own imagination.
What Trump is attempting recalls William Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice, one of the playwright’s most celebrated tragicomedies, where romance intertwines with moral struggle. The story centres on Shylock, a ruthless moneylender who demands a pound of flesh as collateral for an unpaid debt.
By presiding over the Board of Peace and monopolising veto power, Trump is not merely attempting to reshape the international system — he is also seeking to legitimise the extraction and seizure of wealth and influence that belong to nations and future generations, without accountability or restraint.",792,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.8176131844520569,2026-01-28T09:38:46.875066
2026-01-27,"Egypt’s real estate market enters phase of structural correction, global repositioning",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/27/egypts-real-estate-market-enters-phase-of-structural-correction-global-repositioning/,"Senior executives from Egypt’s leading real estate developers say the sector is entering a new phase—one defined by structural correction, stronger fundamentals, and growing global relevance—driven by economic stabilization, rising foreign investment, tourism expansion, and evolving urban development models.
Ayman Amer, General Manager of SODIC, said Egypt is following a trajectory similar to India’s transformation over the past two decades, positioning itself to become a major global hub within the next 10 to 15 years.
Speaking at AmCham Egypt’s Annual Real Estate Conference,
“Egypt Rising: Real Estate as a Regional Powerhouse,”
Amer compared Egypt’s current stage of development to India’s position 20 years ago. While China once dominated global growth narratives, he noted, India’s rise was fueled by population scale, human capital, and increasing institutional professionalism—factors Egypt is now beginning to share.
Amer highlighted information technology and entrepreneurship as key growth engines, describing Egypt as rapidly emerging as a regional hub for IT and digital innovation, supported by a deep and diversified talent pool spanning engineering, healthcare, and education.
Tourism, he added, remains a cornerstone of Egypt’s long-term growth. The country currently generates around $15 billion annually from tourism—well below global peers such as the UAE ($70 billion) and Spain (nearly $129 billion). However, Egypt’s unique historical assets, combined with new landmarks such as the Grand Egyptian Museum, are helping reposition the country on the global tourism map and unlock significant untapped potential.
On investment strategy, Amer argued that real estate offers stronger fundamentals than traditional safe-haven assets such as gold or silver, particularly for institutional and high-net-worth investors.
“Large pools of capital require large, tangible assets,” he said, noting that real estate uniquely meets this requirement while remaining relatively liquid, with a medium-term investment horizon of five to seven years.
Credibility and execution, he added, are essential to attracting regional capital. Developers who consistently deliver projects on time and to specification are strengthening Egypt’s standing among investors from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and beyond.
Foreign Investment and Market Fundamentals
Hazem Helal, Chief Executive Officer of Owest, Makadi Heights, and Byoum, said Egypt’s real estate sector continues to attract direct foreign investment, supported by strong capital inflows from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar.
He noted that foreign currency inflows are increasingly reinforced by Egyptians’ remittances from abroad, which now exceed revenues from both the Suez Canal and tourism—enhancing the sector’s resilience amid global economic uncertainty.
Tourism continues to underpin real estate demand, Helal added, pointing out that Egypt welcomed a record 15 million tourists in 2024, with the sector contributing more than $15 billion to GDP. This growth has directly benefited hospitality-led and mixed-use developments, particularly in coastal destinations.
Helal said real estate development is increasingly shifting away from congested city centers toward emerging and peripheral areas, driven by demand for integrated communities that combine residential, healthcare, education, entertainment, and commercial services.
While acknowledging that property prices rose sharply in recent years, he said the market entered a correction phase in 2025, with more optimistic expectations emerging for 2026, supported by improving economic indicators and more balanced pricing strategies.
Amer rejected claims that Egypt’s real estate prices are inflated, arguing that valuations should be assessed in U.S. dollars rather than local currency. Premium residential prices in Egypt average around $1,000 per square meter, compared to $6,000–$7,000 in GCC markets and $10,000 or more in Europe.
“These figures show Egypt offers premium real estate at roughly 30% of European prices and at half—or less—of GCC levels,” he said.
Nearly 70% of SODIC’s portfolio is classified as ultra-luxury, Amer added, with demand remaining strong from a well-traveled, globally benchmarked customer base.
Helal stressed that a decline in prices per square meter is unlikely, citing continued upward pressure on land values, construction costs, financing expenses, and operating costs. Affordability, he said, will be addressed not through price cuts, but through smarter unit design.
The market, he explained, is moving away from villas sized 400–1,000 square meters toward more efficient layouts that reduce the total ticket price without compromising quality.
Correction, Consolidation, and a Shift Toward Quality
Ahmed Fathy, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Misr Italia Properties, described the current phase as a market correction characterized by consolidation and quality-driven competition.
The shift, he said, is not about lowering prices, but about aligning supply with real demand. The sector is witnessing increased joint ventures and strategic partnerships as weaker players exit the market.
“This phase will likely mean fewer developers—but stronger ones,” Fathy said, noting that well-positioned projects continue to record robust sales, with some launches selling out within hours.
Fathy also highlighted a structural transformation in commercial real estate, where the market has shifted from a landlord-driven model to one increasingly favoring tenants and occupiers.
With rising supply, landlords are now competing on pricing, lease flexibility, functionality, and value-added services, while demand remains strongest for well-designed, adaptable office spaces.
The executives concluded that Egypt’s real estate sector is evolving into a more mature, competitive, and globally integrated market—where long-term success will be defined by execution, innovation, integrated development, and customer-centric design, rather than speculative pricing alone.",843,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9118136167526244,2026-01-28T09:38:54.594703
2026-01-27,Opinion | Between Fact and Exaggeration: Is China Really Controlling Canada?,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/27/opinion-between-fact-and-exaggeration-is-china-really-controlling-canada/,"In recent months, what was once a relatively minor economic story about Canada’s evolving trade relations with China has erupted into a major flashpoint in global geopolitics. At the centre of this storm is U.S. President Donald Trump, whose forceful public remarks claim that China is “successfully and fully controlling Canada” and that such a shift poses an existential threat to U.S. economic interests. Trump has characterised the situation in dramatic terms, suggesting that closer ties between Ottawa and Beijing could lead to China “devouring Canada completely,” affecting its companies, social structure, and way of life.
But to understand whether there is any substance behind these claims, one must look beyond hyperbolic rhetoric and into the actual trade dynamics and strategic interests at play. What Trump’s statements reveal — intentionally or not — is less a reality of Chinese dominance and more a broader struggle for influence in the global economic order between Washington and Beijing, with Canada caught in the geopolitical crossfire.
First, the actual trade relationship between Canada and China, while significant, remains modest in scale compared with Canada’s ties to the United States. In 2024, Canadian exports to China totalled about $21.1bn, accounting for only a small fraction of Canada’s overall exports. By contrast, the United States accounted for more than 75% of Canada’s merchandise exports, amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars — a figure that dwarfs Canadian sales to China by a wide margin.
These numbers provide critical context: China is a notable trade partner, but far from Canada’s dominant export market. Imports from China are larger than exports to China — reflecting Canada’s reliance on Chinese manufactured goods — but still comprise just over 10-12% of Canada’s total imports in the first half of 2025.
Dr. Marwa El-Shinawy
When Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Beijing and announced steps to ease mutual tariffs — such as lower duties on electric vehicles from China in exchange for China reducing tariffs on Canadian agricultural products — these were specific, sector-focused adjustments, not a comprehensive free trade agreement that would fundamentally shift Canada’s economic orientation. Carney repeatedly stated that Ottawa has no intention of pursuing a full free trade deal with China, partly because it must remain compliant with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA), which requires consultation with partners before entering accords with non-market economies like China.
Trump’s response — a threat to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian exports to punish Ottawa for its engagement with Beijing — is not anchored in established trade realities but rather reflects a strategic playbook he has used repeatedly in his confrontations with China. By deploying exaggerated language about “control” and “devouring,” Trump effectively framed a nuanced trade negotiation as if it were a geopolitical takeover, mobilising domestic opinion and applying extreme economic pressure in the form of tariff threats.
From an economic standpoint, such tariff escalations could be devastating for Canada. Given that more than three-quarters of Canada’s export economy relies on the United States, a 100% tariff would render most Canadian goods non-competitive overnight, potentially collapsing entire sectors, shrinking production, threatening jobs, and disrupting deeply integrated supply chains.
Beyond purely bilateral concerns, this episode speaks to a broader trend in which the United States and China are competing to shape the rules of global trade and investment. Trump’s aggressive tariff threats and blame narratives are part of a larger set of policies aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China and curbing what he viewed as unfair trade practices. These measures have included steep U.S. duties on Chinese goods and a willingness to confront allies who seek independent arrangements with Beijing.
Chinese officials, in response, have publicly distanced their actions from any hostile intent towards third parties, emphasising cooperation and mutual benefit in trade with Canada rather than confrontation with the United States. This underscores that the actual economic exchanges are rooted in incremental cooperation — not strategic subjugation.
Strategically, this clash reveals a larger global phenomenon: powerful economies are attempting to defend their spheres of influence while asserting control over trade flows, investment directions, and technological access. Trump’s rhetoric magnifies this contest, leveraging symbolic language and hard-ball economic tactics to galvanise domestic support and pressure both foreign competitors and allied partners. Whether such strategies enhance long-term U.S. influence is debatable, especially as allies like Canada seek to diversify their trade portfolios in a multipolar economic environment.
What some politicians frame simplistically as “Chinese control over Canada” is more accurately understood as a complex interplay of trade priorities, geopolitical posturing, and economic competition. Canada’s trade with China — though substantial in absolute terms — is economically limited relative to its U.S. ties. The broader dispute reflects how nations like the United States react when traditional trade dominance is perceived to be challenged, even modestly. In this context, demands for strategic diversification by middle powers such as Canada are not a sign of Chinese dominance but rather a rational response to an unpredictable geopolitical landscape in which influence is negotiated through both cooperation and competition.
In the end, Trump’s heated language and tariff threats illustrate a larger strategic conflict driven by competing national interests, not an objective reality of Chinese supremacy over Canadian sovereignty. Interpreting these developments requires a balanced understanding of economic data, trade interdependencies, and the geopolitical strategies that major powers deploy as they vie for influence in a rapidly changing global economy.

2026-01-31,ETA reviews tax system evolution and its role in driving investment,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/31/eta-reviews-tax-system-evolution-and-its-role-in-driving-investment/,"The Egyptian Tax Authority (ETA) recently participated in the annual tax conference hosted by Ernst & Young (EY) Egypt, a forum dedicated to exploring the latest shifts in tax policy. The event highlighted ongoing efforts to modernise Egypt’s fiscal framework and evaluated the resulting impact on investment appetites and national economic growth.
Rasha Abdel Aal, Head of the ETA, underscored the vital importance of engaging in specialised dialogues that unite tax authorities with the broader business community. Such platforms are essential for strengthening communication channels and showcasing state-led initiatives to refine the investment climate. Abdel Aal remarked that these ongoing consultations reflect the Authority’s commitment to exchanging technical expertise, fostering private-sector partnerships, and advancing comprehensive tax reforms in line with Ministry of Finance directives.
Ragab Mahrous, Advisor to the Head of the ETA, detailed the second package of tax facilitation measures, which rests on the dual pillars of procedural enhancements and legislative amendments. A cornerstone of this package is the renewal of the Tax Dispute Resolution Law, which is critical for clearing the backlog of outstanding cases since the previous legislative term concluded in mid-2025.
Furthermore, Mahrous confirmed that new legislation would permit recent tax periods to utilise the lump-sum tax system established under Law No. 30 of 2023. This aligns with existing mechanisms for small-scale projects, allowing entities with revenues below EGP 20m to access incentives provided by the Small Projects Law starting from 2025.
To stimulate the capital markets, Mahrous noted a shift in the tax treatment of listed securities, where transactions will now be subject to stamp duty rather than capital gains tax. This move is designed to simplify accounting and encourage institutional investment. Additionally, in coordination with the Financial Regulatory Authority, companies listing on the stock exchange may receive tax incentives for an initial three-year period. These benefits are tied to performance indicators such as trading volume and expansion, with the potential for a further three-year extension based on verified growth and valuation metrics to ensure clear economic outcomes.
Ashraf El-Zayat, Head of the Tax Audit Sector, emphasised that the Ministry of Finance is pivoting toward a relationship with the business community based on mutual trust and partnership. A key priority is the integration of an accelerated VAT refund system, aimed at increasing the volume of processed cases to ensure faster capital turnover for businesses. El-Zayat described the activation of the central clearing system as a qualitative leap, establishing rigid timelines and clear procedural mandates for all state entities to complete clearing procedures and transfer dues within a maximum of 20 days.
The legislative agenda also includes targeted VAT adjustments to support social goals, such as reducing the rate on medical devices from 14% to 5% and exempting components for dialysis machines entirely. To achieve greater fiscal fairness, household soaps and industrial detergents have transitioned to the standard 14% VAT rate, which crucially allows manufacturers to deduct all production inputs in line with international best practices. Soheir Hassan, Head of the First Large Taxpayers Centre, added that the second facilitation package leverages digital transformation to reduce administrative burdens. A significant milestone is the upcoming launch of a mobile application for real estate transactions, allowing citizens to calculate liabilities, upload contracts, and pay taxes remotely without visiting a tax office.
The Authority is also expanding its physical infrastructure through distinguished tax service centres in New Cairo, New Alamein, and Sheikh Zayed. These hubs will provide high-speed processing and specialised support for all categories of taxpayers. Furthermore, the introduction of the Tax Excellence Card will reward compliant taxpayers with fast-track service channels and priority access to advance ruling units, dedicated investor support desks, and accelerated refund procedures. Finally, Afaf Ibrahim, Assistant to the Head of the ETA, addressed the complexities of international taxation, noting that efforts are underway to separate transfer pricing audits from standard commercial audits to ensure a more technical and effective application of the law.",650,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.6582714915275574,2026-02-01T09:32:56.559379

Speaking at the third annual meeting of the Public Financial Management (PFM) coordination committee, Sobhi stated that the ministry is committed to completing its management development path by deepening cooperation with international partners to ensure resources meet the actual needs of the state’s reform plan. This coordination aims to support the implementation of reform efforts, stimulate economic growth, and improve the efficiency of public services and social protection programmes.
The meeting was attended by representatives from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the British Embassy, the European Union, the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, and the United Nations Development Programme. During the session, Sobhi reviewed fiscal performance and reforms enacted over the last year, highlighting the first-time application of a medium-term budgetary framework and the shift toward a programme and performance-based system.
The deputy minister noted that the ministry has developed new tools for government debt and fiscal risk management, alongside the introduction of tax facilities and a medium-term fiscal strategy that has improved overall economic indicators. Sobhi reported that Egypt achieved a high growth rate during the first quarter of the current fiscal year and sawan increase in private investment, industrial activity, and exports. He added that tax revenues rose without imposing additional burdens on the business community, contributing to a primary surplus and a reduction in inflation rates.
Participants at the meeting discussed the outcomes of cooperation with international financial institutions between 2023 and 2025 and established objectives for the upcoming year to avoid the duplication of activities. Sobhi explained that the ministry’s future priorities include expanding digital transformation and the use of Artificial Intelligence in public financial management to improve data-driven decision-making and sustainability.
The ministry is also working to complete the implementation of gender and climate-responsive budgeting, internal auditing, and government procurement reforms. Sobhi concluded by emphasising the importance of enhancing communication with citizens through simplified fiscal reporting to ensure transparency regarding the state’s financial objectives.",362,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8971588015556335,2026-02-01T09:33:18.408743

The hospital, which features 11 operating rooms and 47 intensive care beds, is designed to provide medical services to approximately 7 million residents, according to Ahmed Nadi al-Shuweikh, the facility’s director. Madbouly, accompanied by the ministers of industry and higher education, said the visit focused on monitoring the implementation of projects under the “Haya Karima” (Decent Life) initiative to ensure they enter service for local citizens.
Minya University President Essam el-Din Farhat said the governorate’s university hospitals currently provide 2 million medical services annually across 1,700 beds. He added that ongoing projects, including the Triple University Hospital and specialised units for ophthalmology, oncology, and paediatrics, will add a further 1,050 beds to the regional healthcare system.
In the industrial sector, Madbouly visited the Giza Garments factory, which currently operates 45 production lines with2,200 employees. Fadel Marzouq, chairman of Giza Spinning and Weaving, stated that the facility exports goods worth $4m per month. Marzouq outlined expansion plans to increase the workforce to 7,000 and raise annual exports to $150m by 2028 through the opening of three additional factories. The company currently operates in a 50-50 partnership with Vietnam’s Golden Avenue.
The Prime Minister also inspected the United Company for Drying Agricultural Crops, where total investment has reached $41m following the addition of an $11m production line. Executive Director Jonathan Haney said the plant relies 100% on local raw materials and exports more than 90% of its output. The facility currently produces 7,000 tonnes of dried products annually, including onions and garlic, with a target capacity of 10,000 tonnes.
Deputy Prime Minister for Industrial Development Kamel al-Wazir noted that Minya’s availability of raw materials makes it a primary hub for food industries and value-added agricultural exports.
Regarding housing, Madbouly distributed contracts for the first phase of a 508m EGP residential project in the South Minya district. The project provides 31 buildings as alternative housing for families previously living in precarious “emergency blocks” built in 1981. Governor Emad Kedwany confirmed that nine buildings have been completed, with the remainder scheduled for completion between 2025 and 2027. Each unit includes two rooms and private facilities, replacing the previous shared-utility model.

On the assets side, the CBE explained that cash balances at banks stood at around EGP 204.715bn. Banks’ balances with one another domestically totalled around EGP 2.825trn, while their balances with banks abroad reached around EGP 1.594trn. It added that lending and discount balances to customers recorded around EGP 9.596trn, while the securities portfolio and banks’ investments in Treasury bills totalled EGP 7.423trn. The volume of other assets — which the CBE did not detail — amounted to around EGP 3.108trn.
On the liabilities side, the CBE said banks’ capital stood at around EGP 595.816bn, reserves at EGP 987.160bn, and provisions at around EGP 646.690bn. Banks’ liabilities to one another domestically totalled around EGP 1.473trn, while liabilities to banks abroad stood at EGP 661.742bn. Total deposits amounted to EGP 15.063trn, while bonds and long-term loans totalled EGP 968.596bn. Other liabilities — which the CBE did not detail — amounted to around EGP 4.355trn.
In more detail, the CBE said customer deposits at banks rose to EGP 15.187trn by end-August 2025, compared with EGP 14.954trn at end-July, an increase of EGP 233bn. According to the CBE, government deposits at banks totalled around EGP 3.031trn, including around EGP 2.571trn in local currency and the equivalent of around EGP 460.315bn in foreign currencies. Non-government deposits amounted to EGP 12.156trn, including around EGP 8.971trn in local currency and the equivalent of around EGP 3.184trn in foreign currencies.
The report noted that the public business sector accounted for around EGP 158.696bn of total non-government deposits in local currency, while the private business sector’s share was EGP 1.484trn, the household sector EGP 7.277trn, and non-residents EGP 51.026bn. Meanwhile, in foreign-currency non-government deposits, the public business sector accounted for the equivalent of EGP 197.014bn, the private business sector the equivalent of EGP 1.020trn, the household sector the equivalent of EGP 1.852trn, and non-residents the equivalent of EGP 115.110bn.
The Central Bank of Egypt said the household sector accounted for 76.1% of total deposits at banks. It noted that this sector held around 81.6% of total deposits in local currency, while its share of foreign-currency deposits stood at around 60.3%. It added that the growth rate in total deposits at banks during August 2025 reached around 23.4%. The growth rate in local-currency deposits was 26.4%, while the growth rate in foreign-currency deposits was 15.5%. The CBE noted that the share of foreign-currency deposits reached 25.60% of total bank deposits by end-August 2025.
By contrast, the CBE revealed that credit facilities balances at banks rose to EGP 9.596trn by end-August 2025, an increase of around EGP 274.5bn compared with end-June 2025. Credit facilities refer to loans granted by banks to their customers, as well as letters of credit and letters of guarantee opened for them to cover import operations. The CBE attributed the increase to a rise in credit facilities granted by banks to the non-government sector by EGP 164.4bn, up 3.7%, and credit facilities granted to the government by EGP 110.1bn, up 2.3%.
According to the CBE, the increase in balances granted to the government was driven by higher local-currency balances of EGP 45.4bn and higher foreign-currency balances equivalent to EGP 64.7bn. It added that, based on the relative distribution of non-government credit facilities balances, the private business sector received 59.9% of total balances. By economic activity, the industrial sector received 33.2% of those balances, followed by services at 27.2%, then trade at 8.6%, and agriculture at 1.5%. Undistributed sectors accounted for 29.5%, including 29.3% for the household sector.
The CBE’s figures also showed that domestic liquidity in the banking sector rose by around EGP 315.2bn during July and August 2025, reaching around EGP 13.388trn, a growth rate of 2.4%. The CBE said the increase resulted from a rise in quasi-money of around EGP 176.3bn, up 1.8%, and an increase in money supply of around EGP 138.9bn, up 4.1%.
It explained that the rise in quasi-money was driven by higher non-current deposits in local currency by EGP 198.6bn, up 3%, and a decline in foreign-currency deposits equivalent to EGP 22.3bn, down 0.7%. The increase in money supply resulted from higher current deposits in local currency by EGP 121.8bn, up 6.1%, and an increase in currency in circulation outside the banking system of around EGP 17.1bn, up 1.2%. The CBE said the increase in domestic liquidity during July and August was the net result of a rise in net domestic assets and net foreign assets of the banking system.
The CBE revealed that net domestic assets in the banking sector rose over the same two months by around EGP 186.7bn, up 1.5%, as a net result of an increase in domestic credit of around EGP 659.6bn, up 4.4%, and a decline in net items of the monetary survey by around EGP 472.9bn. It said domestic credit rose due to higher net claims on government of EGP 49.6bn, and higher claims on the private business sector of EGP 72.5bn, on the public business sector of EGP 74bn, and on the household sector of around EGP 60.5bn.
Net foreign assets of the banking system increased during July and August 2025 by the equivalent of EGP 128.5bn, a growth rate of 17.3%. It said this increase was driven by a rise in net foreign assets at banks equivalent to EGP 110.9bn, and at the central bank equivalent to EGP 17.6bn. In the same context, the CBE said reserve money rose over the same period by EGP 84.9bn, up 3.7%, reaching around EGP 2.405trn by end-August 2025.
It explained that this was the net result of higher local-currency deposits of banks at the central bank by around EGP 79.2bn, up 9.7%, and higher currency in circulation outside the central bank’s vaults by around EGP 5.7bn, up 0.4%. According to the CBE, the rise in reserve money was the net result of an increase in net claims on government of EGP 161.4bn, net items of the monetary survey by EGP 5.2bn, and net foreign assets at the central bank equivalent to EGP 17.6bn on the one hand, and a decline in net claims on banks of EGP 99.3bn on the other.",1065,daily_news_egypt,error,0.0,2026-02-01T09:34:26.486405
2026-01-31,Opinion | The Grand Barter: Accounting Ambition vs. Strategic Stability,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/31/opinion-the-grand-barter-accounting-ambition-vs-strategic-stability/,"Protecting the Suez Canal as a sovereign asset and the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) as the guardian of monetary policy requires both to remain on strictly independent tracks. At first glance, the idea of transferring the Suez Canal’s assets or revenue flows to the Central Bank appears to be a clever manoeuvre of financial engineering. However, at its core, this proposal raises fundamental questions that go to the heart of economic national security and the very independence of the Central Bank. The concept centres on the government transferring ownership of the Canal’s assets or flows to the CBE in exchange for writing off the state’s massive indebtedness to the institution. Below is an in-depth analysis of this proposal, weighing the structural risks against the procedural claims.
Contents
The Case for Rejection: A Structural Perspective
The Case for Support: A Procedural Perspective
Final Assessment: A Cosmetic Solution to a Structural Problem
Conclusion
The Case for Rejection: A Structural Perspective
The primary function of a Central Bank is oversight and the management of monetary policy, not the direct management of commercial or industrial assets. Ownership of productive assets like the Canal would create a glaring conflict of interest and weaken the bank’s international credibility as an independent regulator. This is particularly sensitive at a time when the CBE is actively seeking to dispose of its historic stakes in commercial banks, such as United Bank, to sharpen its focus on regulatory duties.
Furthermore, the Suez Canal is a sovereign entity governed by a unique set of laws. Converting it into a mere financial asset would involve immense legislative and constitutional complexities. Placing the Canal on the CBE’s balance sheet would also make the stability of the Egyptian pound a hostage to geopolitical tensions. Any disruption in global shipping would directly impact the bank’s financial position, potentially undermining the currency’s strength during international crises.
There is also the significant risk of falling into a “window dressing” trap. Moving debt from the Ministry of Finance’s ledger to the Central Bank’s balance sheet is a paper settlement rather than a structural one. The state, viewed as a unified entity, remains just as indebted as before. The danger lies in creating a false sense of financial security that may inadvertently encourage renewed borrowing and fiscal expansion rather than the necessary restraint.
Finally, global rating agencies such as Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s focus heavily on net liquid assets. Replacing sovereign debt with an illiquid asset like the Canal could be interpreted as a weakening of the Central Bank’s liquidity position. Traditionally, a central bank’s assets should remain in gold, cash, and readily marketable international securities rather than fixed infrastructure that cannot be easily liquidated.
The Case for Support: A Procedural Perspective
Proponents of the plan argue from a standpoint of balance sheet optimisation. They suggest that converting “non-yielding” government debt into “productive” assets that generate hard currency would enhance the realism and strength of the Central Bank’s balance sheet. By writing off this debt, the state budget would also save billions of pounds in interest payments, effectively reducing the deficit and creating much-needed fiscal room for social spending and infrastructure development.
From a legal standpoint, some believe that placing the Canal under the Central Bank’s umbrella could grant it a higher degree of “sovereign immunity” against foreign international claims or legal judgments. Additionally, this arrangement could provide greater securitisation flexibility. It would theoretically enable the CBE to issue bonds backed by the Canal’s reliable revenue streams at a lower cost, leveraging the bank’s strong creditworthiness to attract fresh investment.
Final Assessment: A Cosmetic Solution to a Structural Problem
Out of professional duty and constructive engagement with these critical issues, I find myself wary of this proposal inboth form and substance. Despite its accounting logic, it remains a cosmetic rather than a structural solution. Placing both the heart of the financial system and the nation’s most important source of dollar revenue into a single basket represents a major concentration risk. This measure could also lead to covert “inflationary debt financing,” which risks reigniting consumer price hikes just as the economy seeks stability.
The government may find this idea attractive as a numerical lifeline to slash the debt-to-GDP ratio, but the cost would be crossing a significant political and popular “red line” regarding the Canal. Furthermore, the IMF is likely to oppose such a move, as the Fund places immense weight on Central Bank independence and the transparency of structural reforms.
Conclusion
The absence of successful international precedents, combined with warnings from global institutions, makes this proposal a venture with uncertain and potentially volatile consequences. Protecting the Suez Canal and the Central Bank requires each to remain on its own independent track. A sustainable solution lies in the genuine development of resources and productive growth—not in the mere rearrangement of assets within the state’s vaults.

2026-01-31,Gold prices fall sharply in Egypt as global markets retreat from record highs,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/01/31/gold-prices-fall-sharply-in-egypt-as-global-markets-retreat-from-record-highs/,"Gold prices in the Egyptian market fell sharply on Saturday as global rates retreated from record highs following the nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next US Federal Reserve Chair.
The price of 21-carat gold, the local benchmark, dropped by approximately EGP 80 on Friday to reach EGP 6,670 per gram. This followed a volatile week where local prices opened at EGP 7,350 and closed at EGP 6,750, representing a weekly loss of roughly EGP 600 per gram, according to data from iSagha, a platform specialising in gold and jewellery.
The downturn in Egypt mirrored a significant correction in international markets, where the gold ounce fell approximately $93 on Friday to close at $4,895. Earlier in the week, global gold had hit an all-time high of $5,602 per ounce. Despite the late-month sell-off, global gold recorded monthly gains of 13.4% for January.
Saeed Embaby, Chief Executive of iSagha, reported that the 24-carat gram reached EGP 7,623, while 18-carat gold stood at EGP 5,717 and the gold pound was priced near EGP 53,360.
Embaby noted that local gold had previously been priced between EGP 300 and EGP 500 above global rates. While the market was permitted time to adjust, rapid global fluctuations and high demand complicated immediate price alignment. He stated that local prices must now match global levels, noting the current gap stands at approximately EGP 230. Embaby added that any persistent, unjustified gaps would be publicly clarified.
The global sell-off on Friday, which saw gold drop over 10% and silver fall about 30% after exceptional January gains, was driven by the strengthening of the US dollar and Treasury yields following Warsh’s nomination. The US dollar index rose 0.74% to 96.87, while the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.247%.
High consecutive price increases had previously sparked unprecedented demand in Egypt, particularly for bullion and gold pounds, which exceeded local production capacities. Delivery schedules for some manufacturers have subsequently extended from two days to up to three weeks.
Despite the fluctuations, trading in Egypt continued. While some traders paused operations for speculative reasons, others maintained buying and selling activities based on available stock. Embaby advised investors who purchased at higher levels to hold their assets, suggesting the current drop does not signal the end of an upward trend and noting positive forecasts through the end of the year.
Analysts indicated that fundamental support for gold remains firm due to rising global debt, weak confidence in the dollar, and ongoing geopolitical risks. Precious metals are expected to maintain an upward trend into 2026, with price dips viewed as potential buying opportunities.

The plan includes tenders totalling EGP 2.703tn during the third quarter of FY 2025/2026 to repay maturing debt instruments and finance the state budget deficit.
CBE, which conducts the tenders on behalf of the government, will offer in February 16 Treasury bill tenders worth EGP 660bn, 13 Treasury bond tenders worth EGP 172bn, in addition to two sukuk tenders worth EGP 11bn.
According to the plan, Treasury bills worth EGP 100bn will be offered with a 91-day maturity, EGP 160bn with a 182-day maturity, and EGP 190bn with a 273-day maturity, while 364-day T-bills worth EGP 210bn are also scheduled.
The plan also includes the issuance of two-year Treasury bonds worth EGP 48bn, including EGP 12bn in zero-coupon bonds, alongside three-year bonds worth EGP 90bn and five-year bonds worth EGP 34bn, including EGP 4bn in floating-rate bonds.
In addition, the ministry plans to issue two local fixed-return sukuk tenders worth a total of EGP 11bn.
Banks operating in the Egyptian market remain the largest investors in Treasury bills and bonds issued regularly by the government to finance the state budget deficit.

Speaking at the Association of Real Estate Developers (arD) summit, Masoud disclosed that the Housing Committee is actively reviewing the Occupants Union Law to strengthen market discipline. He stated that coordinating the relationship between developers, clients, and regulatory authorities is essential to balancing the interests of all stakeholders.
The legislator highlighted the real estate industry as a primary driver of national economic growth, noting that approximately 60% of related industries and activities are tied to the sector. Despite this, Masoud noted that the industry receives comparatively little government support, particularly after facing challenges from global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukrainian war, which led to sharp price increases and currency fluctuations.
Regarding current regulations, Masoud addressed updates to the Building Violations Reconciliation Law. He explained that recent amendments now grant the Prime Minister the authority to extend reconciliation periods, providing greater flexibility to maximise the law’s effectiveness.
To enhance state revenues and market competitiveness, Masoud advocated for the promotion of real estate exports. He called for the introduction of specific incentives for foreign investors, including the provision of residency or citizenship options.

The commercial project is being developed in collaboration with Hafez Consultants as design consultant and KAD Commercial Property Management for operations. El-Menshawy stated that the mall was conceived as a long-term investment asset rather than a project intended solely for sale, with a strategic focus on high occupancy rates and sustainable returns.
The development spans approximately 5,000 square metres on Lotus Street at the main entrance of Touristic Area (A) in Hadayek October. The site overlooks two 60-metre-wide roads near the Middle Ring Road and Fayoum Road, situated opposite the Etala Compound and adjacent to the Japanese School.
“The project reflects the company’s strategic vision to deliver competitive and sustainable developments based on comprehensive market research,” El-Menshawy said, noting that the “First Plaza” name signifies the beginning of a planned series of mixed-use projects.
Ismail El-Menshawy, Managing Director of Al Emarat Development, said the mall will feature a mix of commercial, administrative, and medical units. Facilities will include retail outlets, restaurants, a hypermarket, children’s entertainment areas, and electric vehicle charging stations.
Sales Director Sobhy Adel confirmed that commercial units start from 25 square metres, while administrative and medical units begin at 40 square metres. The project is scheduled for delivery within two and a half years.

The project was officially unveiled by Soheir Karim, Non-Executive Chairperson of Wealth Holding, as part of the firm’s 2026 expansion strategy. The development, spanning approximately 30 feddans, is designed as a fully serviced residential community featuring a mix of standalone villas, twin houses, townhouses, and serviced apartments.
Mohamed Mamdouh, CEO and Managing Director of Wealth Holding, stated that Citra Residence is being developed in four sales phases to meet rising demand in the region.

Speaking in a phone interview on Al Hekaya TV program, Talaat Moustafa explained that current prices maintain only a modest profit margin for developers, making price reductions unfeasible, particularly given the ongoing rise in construction and execution costs.
He highlighted that the market is witnessing strong sales activity, noting that developers achieved robust results in January. His own group reportedly sold an entire project in Sharm El-Sheikh within just 24 hours at the end of December.
Total sales for the company in January reached approximately EGP 13bn, including EGP 1bn in a single day, marking significant year-on-year growth.
Regarding ready-to-deliver units, Talaat Moustafa confirmed that prices are not expected to drop, pointing out that the alternative for buyers would involve higher costs, thereby preserving the market value of existing units.
He emphasized that purchasing ready units in cash without interest charges presents a valuable investment opportunity, as such prices are unlikely to be repeated due to rising costs.
He further noted that prices for new units six months from now are expected to be higher than current levels, reinforcing the incentive for buyers to act promptly.
Talaat Moustafa dismissed any claims of a slowdown in the resale market, citing rising rates of unit transfers within his company as evidence of sustained demand.
Highlighting real estate’s long-term value, he stated that property investment has historically yielded higher returns than the U.S. dollar over the past 50 years.
He concluded by projecting that annual demand for housing in Egypt will not fall below 900,000 units over the next 30 years, with 150,000 to 250,000 units specifically targeted at the segment capable of purchasing them.",327,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.4816938638687134,2026-02-02T09:53:41.459177

The service utilizes Soft POS applications, enabling smart devices to function as payment terminals. Under the new system, merchants can accept payments from various contactless cards by downloading an application, with card PINs entered directly on the device through internationally accredited and secure protocols.
“The new service aligns with the CBE’s progressive efforts to enable the infrastructure for the expansion of electronic payment systems and to facilitate financial transactions for citizens and merchants,” said CBE Governor Hassan Abdalla. He added that the move supports financial inclusion and enhances access to electronic financial services.
The CBE stated that the initiative aims to transition the country toward a less-cash society and achieve Egypt’s Vision 2030. By using mobile devices as terminals, the service eliminates purchase and maintenance costs associated with traditional POS hardware for payment service providers and merchants.
The regulator noted that the system is designed to integrate small enterprises into the electronic payment ecosystem while offering customers a swifter and more flexible payment experience.

The Great Liquidity Shift
The convergence of maturing bank debt and a “light correction” in precious metals has created a unique liquidity event in the Egyptian economy. While gold has provided historic returns over the past two years, local investors are now prioritising assets with lower daily volatility and tangible utility. This shift is underpinned by a demographic reality—a million new marriages annually—and a construction cost floor that industry leaders argue makes a price drop fundamentally impossible.
Cost-Push Reality: Why Prices Defy Gravity
The narrative that Egyptian property prices might cool is being met with firm resistance from the sector’s largest players. Hisham Talaat Moustafa, CEO and Managing Director of
Talaat Moustafa Group (TMG)
, addressed these concerns directly, dismissing talk of a price retreat as “incorrect.”
“Property pricing is fundamentally tied to cost—the price of land and building materials,” Moustafa explained during an appearance on MBC Masr.
With the prices of iron, cement, and oil-linked inputs continuing to climb, Moustafa argues that current market margins are already limited. His group’s performance serves as a bellwether for the industry:
EGP 13bn
in sales achieved in January alone.
New projects in Sharm El-Sheikh sold out within
24 hours
.
Demand consistently outstrips supply across both luxury and primary residential segments.
Demographics vs. Speculation
A core driver for the market’s resilience is Egypt’s unique demographic profile. Unlike European markets facing population decline, 65% of Egyptians are under the age of 30. This creates a structural demand for approximately
1m
new units every year for the next three decades.
“The demand is real, not speculative,” Moustafa noted, highlighting that over the last 50 years, real estate in Egypt has outperformed the US dollar. He advises that for those with liquid capital, purchasing units in “cash” remains the most effective way to hedge against future inflationary cycles and rising construction costs.
Hany Genena
Gold Correction and the Search for Stability
Economist Hany Genena views the current market movement as a “rebalancing.” While gold and silver have seen intense speculation and recent “light corrections,” the fundamental appetite from central banks and the jewellery industry remains stable. However, the psychological shift is already underway.
“These fluctuations may drive some investors to exit gold and move toward real estate, which offers more stability,” Genena stated. He added that the influx of liquidity from maturing bank certificates would likely create a “state of balance” in the property market, preventing a vacuum as other asset classes cool.
The Global Backdrop
The outlook for Egypt is also being shaped by broader geopolitical and economic shifts:
US Economy:
Expected strength over the next two years is likely to support emerging markets, despite a weaker dollar.
Trade Corridors:
European efforts to enhance trade with North Africa and India present Egypt with new economic opportunities.
Asset Performance:
While agricultural commodities remain stable, industrial metals like copper and aluminium continue to see price strength, further insulating the “cost-push” inflation in the housing sector.
A Forward-Looking Outlook
As the market moves deeper into 2026, the transition from “paper wealth” in certificates and “liquid wealth” in gold back into “hard wealth” in property appears to be the defining trend of the year. For the Egyptian investor, the home remains the ultimate hedge—a sentiment echoed by Moustafa’s observation that any new units brought to market will inevitably carry a higher price tag than those available today.",654,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.4931689798831939,2026-02-02T09:54:08.620949
2026-02-01,"Egypt’s chemical, fertilizers exports exceed $9.4bn in 2025, up 7.4%",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/02/01/egypts-chemical-fertilizers-exports-exceed-9-4bn-in-2025-up-7-4/,"Egypt’s exports of chemical products and fertilizers recorded strong growth in 2025, surpassing $9.4bn, according to official data released by the Export Council for Chemical Industries and Fertilizers.
The council reported that total exports of the sector reached approximately $9.43bn from January to December 2025, compared to $8.78bn in 2024, marking an increase of about $650 million and a 7.4% year-on-year growth rate.
This positive performance reflects sustained external demand for Egyptian chemical and fertilizer products, alongside improved performance across several key product groups, particularly fertilizers, basic chemicals, and intermediate chemical products. The growth further strengthens the sector’s contribution to Egypt’s non-oil exports.
The council noted that export growth was supported by the diversification of international markets and the ability of Egyptian companies to maintain competitiveness despite global economic challenges and increasingly stringent quality, environmental, and technical requirements.
Italy topped the list of importing countries in 2025, with exports valued at around $1.284 billion, followed by Turkey at $1.103bn, and Brazil at approximately $652m. Other major destinations included Saudi Arabia ($580.9m), France ($479.5m), Spain ($471.7m), Libya ($298m), Belgium ($265.4m), Morocco ($251.6m), and Lebanon ($228.9m).
Exports to the top ten importing countries totaled about $5.62bn, accounting for nearly 60% of the sector’s total exports, highlighting the strategic importance of these markets.
Commenting on the results, Eng. Khaled Abou El Makarem, Chairman of the Export Council for Chemical Industries and Fertilizers, said that the 2025 performance reflects the continuous efforts made in cooperation with member companies and relevant stakeholders to boost exports. He emphasized that the sector is a key pillar of Egypt’s industrial, export, and investment landscape.
Abou El Makarem added that the council places strong emphasis on supporting exporters in meeting international technical and environmental standards, particularly in light of the global shift toward green transformation, to enhance access to European, African, and other promising markets.
For his part, Mohamed Magued, Executive Director of the council, said that export growth in 2025 was driven by a package of practical measures, including organizing trade missions abroad, hosting foreign buyer delegations, and facilitating direct B2B meetings, in addition to ongoing coordination with government entities and development partners.
Looking ahead, the council announced an ambitious export growth plan for 2026, focusing on opening new markets—especially in Africa, Asia, and Latin America—integrating more small and medium-sized enterprises into the export system, supporting sustainability and green transition, increasing value-added products, and intensifying trade missions and buyer engagements.
The council reaffirmed its commitment to enhancing the competitiveness of the chemical and fertilizers sector and increasing its contribution to Egypt’s export revenues, in line with the state’s goals for sustainable economic growth and stronger industrial exports.",439,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9557723999023438,2026-02-02T09:54:20.622692

The seminar, moderated by Abdel Moneim Said, brought together economists, university professors, and visitors to review the country’s integrated development framework.
Al-Mashat highlighted that the Narrative was developed to integrate Egypt Vision 2030 with the Government Program, responding to global economic changes since 2020. It establishes an integrated planning framework, defines national, regional, and sectoral strategies, and sets measurable performance targets for ministries and government entities.
The Narrative also links development outcomes to financial performance through a programs-and-performance approach, promoting accountability and sustainable growth.
Key pillars include spatial justice, regional development, and leveraging the competitive advantages of each governorate. Al-Mashat emphasized President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi’s directives to expand development corridors, increase productivity, and focus on governorates, citing Upper Egypt’s textile industry growth and new clusters in Sinai.
Public investment governance has opened space for private sector growth, with private investments now accounting for 65% of total investments and a target of over 70% by 2030.
The Minister also discussed policies enhancing private sector empowerment, competitive neutrality, and business environment reforms under the National Structural Reforms Program.
Egypt’s Narrative prioritizes 28 industries with comparative advantages, supporting export growth and integration into global supply chains, with the Suez Canal Economic Zone playing a key role in attracting diversified investments in technology, industry, and energy.
Al-Mashat emphasized the importance of managing future economic expectations, improving transparency, and enabling citizens and businesses to make informed decisions.
International cooperation and partnerships remain a cornerstone of the Narrative, with 58 joint committees supporting trade, investment, and supply chains, alongside a dedicated chapter on economic diplomacy and African relations.
Concluding the seminar, Al-Mashat reiterated that the Narrative’s theme, “Driving Economic Change… Enhancing Quality of Life”, places human development and quality of life at the forefront, with programs targeting all age groups as a foundation for sustainable economic growth and competitiveness. She noted that the second edition will expand on national security, service sectors, and ongoing initiatives such as the fifteenth Economic Census.",361,daily_news_egypt,neutral,0.5953077077865601,2026-02-02T09:54:25.620265
2026-02-01,Local Gold prices jumped by EGP 995 in January,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/02/01/local-gold-prices-jumped-by-egp-995-in-january/,"Gold prices in the local market recorded strong gains in January, jumping by around EGP 995, despite steep declines observed in the final days of the month, according to a report issued by online gold and jewellery trading platform iSagha.
Saied Embaby, Chief Executive of iSagha, stated that the price of 21-carat gold opened January trading at EGP 5,830 per gram and reached an all-time high of EGP 7,550, before closing the month at EGP 6,825. On the other hand, 24-carat gold settled at around EGP 7,800 per gram by the end of trading, 18-carat gold at EGP 5,850, and the gold pound at approximately EGP 54,600.
Globally, gold prices surged by about $577, or 13.4%, during January. The ounce began the month at $4,318, touched a peak of $5,605, and closed at $4,895.
The local market recorded its largest single-day loss in history last Friday, with prices falling by nearly EGP 600 per gram, in tandem with a sharp global decline that saw gold drop by more than $510 per ounce.
Commenting on the pricing gaps, Embaby explained that local prices remain higher than their global equivalents by up to EGP 405. He attributed this to the intensity and speed of global price fluctuations, in addition to strong demand, which have made it difficult for some traders to keep pace with real-time movements. He stressed that the platform would transparently clarify any unjustified pricing gaps to the public.
Embaby also noted that the gold market is not suffering from a shortage of raw material; however, demand is exceeding the production capacity of factories, placing pressure on the market. In contrast, the silver market is facing two simultaneous challenges. They are a shortage of raw materials and factories’ inability to meet rising demand, making itmore vulnerable to volatility.
He stressed that sharp declines in gold prices do not signal the end of the upward trend. He forecasted a return to gains after a period of relative calm, and advised those who purchased gold at high levels to hold on to it to recover losses, amid continued positive expectations through the end of the year.",354,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.9459114074707032,2026-02-02T09:54:30.718638
2026-02-01,Egypt’s Rees Tech targets EGP 1bn sales in 2026 on solar energy boom,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/02/01/egypts-rees-tech-targets-egp-1bn-sales-in-2026-on-solar-energy-boom/,"Egyptian renewable energy solutions firm Rees Tech is targeting sales of approximately EGP 1bn in 2026, driven by a rapid increase in demand for solar systems across the local market, Chairperson Ibrahim Gamal said.
The 2026 target represents a doubling of the company’s business volume compared to 2025, when revenues reached approximately EGP 500m. Gamal attributed the projected growth to the accelerating adoption of solar energy in the agricultural and industrial sectors, as well as off-grid applications.
Rees Tech, which operates as a specialised trading company, provides integrated solutions for solar power plants, including inverters, solar panels, batteries, and protection products. The company began operations in 2015 as an installation contractor before expanding into direct imports in 2019, a transition Gamal said positioned the firm among the leading players in Egypt’s solar market.
A significant turning point for the company was the import of Chinese V&T inverters designed specifically for water pumping systems. Gamal noted that the company’s commitment to price discipline, consistent inventory, and after-sales service led to securing exclusive agency rights for the brand. He described the V&T inverters as highly reliable for pumping applications due to their low failure rates, smooth operating systems, and remote-control capabilities.
The company has established a distribution network of approximately 50 distributors, comprising 10 main distributors and 30 to 40 sub-distributors, focused on key agricultural regions nationwide. Gamal stated that the firm maintains a market protection policy to safeguard distributor margins and ensure long-term stability.
In addition to inverters, Rees Tech’s portfolio includes Snobly batteries, cables, and protection products. The company distributes solar panels from global manufacturers JA Solar and LONGi, and recently secured the exclusive agency for AIKO solar panels in Egypt.
To mitigate supply disruptions and market volatility, Rees Tech currently holds inventory sufficient to cover three to four months of demand, Gamal said. He added that this inventory strategy is central to meeting rising demand and achieving growth targets.
Looking ahead, the chairperson expects anticipated increases in global solar panel prices to further boost the overall market value of solar-related businesses in Egypt throughout 2026.",346,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7097784876823425,2026-02-02T09:54:38.623361

The company is diversifying its operations beyond residential developments into hospitality, sports, and education through partnerships with local and international entities. The new hospitality brand will manage the firm’s own hotel projects as well as third-party developments, Allam revealed.
Hassan Allam Properties currently has four hotels under development in New Cairo, 6th of October City, and the North Coast. With a total capacity of approximately 700 rooms, these projects are scheduled to begin operations in 2028 and 2029.
“The company’s diversified portfolio currently includes more than 25 projects,” Allam said, noting that the firm is currently prioritising the completion of eight ongoing projects in Mostakbal City, the North Coast, and El Gouna before considering new developments in the New Administrative Capital.
Addressing market conditions, Allam stated that Egypt’s real estate sector remains promising due to population growth, characterising the current climate as a return to normal growth rates rather than a downturn. He noted that demand remains strong and projected that prices for some of the company’s projects could increase by 5% to 10% during the current year.
Regarding project financing, Allam described seeking external funding as a standard practice at certain project stages. He emphasised that the company maintains strong relationships with financial institutions to support its execution and expansion plans.
Mostakbal City remains a primary focus for the company’s investments, having served as a foundation for its current diversified project portfolio, Allam added.",268,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.5416211485862732,2026-02-02T09:54:50.410266

In parallel, the Authority issued Decision No. 2 of 2026, increasing the maximum insurance coverage for microinsurance activities to EGP 390,000, up from about EGP 312,500 previously.
In a statement released on Monday, the FRA said the two decisions aim to enhance the capacity of microenterprises to grow and achieve sustainability by expanding access to financing, while also strengthening insurance protection and empowerment for beneficiaries.
Mohamed Farid, Chairperson of the FRA, said the measures are part of the Authority’s broader efforts to develop a regulatory environment that supports microenterprise growth and enables owners to access financing and insurance solutions aligned with their actual needs.
He pointed to indicators showing the growing role of the sector in supporting economic activity, noting that the value of non-banking finance directed to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises reached around EGP 95.7bn in 2025, marking a growth rate of 12.1%. The number of beneficiaries also rose to approximately 3.1 million, reflecting the expanding reach of non-banking financial services.
Farid added that raising the maximum insurance coverage enhances the level of protection available to beneficiaries and provides a more appropriate insurance umbrella that reflects the nature of risks faced by microenterprise owners, supporting their stability and ability to continue and expand their activities.
He said the move is also consistent with the Authority’s approach to improving the efficiency of the non-banking financial services system and offering more suitable financing and insurance solutions for economically vulnerable segments, including workshop owners, artisans, small trades, and home-based enterprises. These measures provide affordable protection that helps mitigate the impact of unexpected shocks on income and business continuity.
Separately, the FRA issued Decision No. 4 of 2026, extending by an additional six months the deadline granted to companies operating in insurance and reinsurance brokerage, loss adjusting and damage assessment, and insurance consultancy expertise to increase their capital.
The Authority had previously decided in January 2025 to require companies operating in insurance and reinsurance brokerage, loss adjusting and damage assessment, insurance consultancy, and actuarial expertise to raise their capital within one year.
Under the new decision, affected companies must submit a detailed timeline outlining the stages of capital increases to the FRA within one month from the decision’s publication. The decision also prohibits the distribution of cash dividends to shareholders before meeting minimum capital requirements, unless prior no-objection is obtained from the Authority.
The extension aims to give companies sufficient time to comply with capital requirements, supporting stronger financial positions and greater sector resilience.
Insurance and reinsurance brokerage companies are required to raise their capital to a minimum of EGP 5m, while risk assessment expertise firms, loss adjusting and damage assessment companies, insurance consultancy expertise firms, and actuarial expertise companies must increase their capital to at least EGP 3m by June 2026.",494,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.9417263269424438,2026-02-03T09:43:02.382144

Speaking at a conference organised with the Austrian Chamber of Commerce and Austrian companies operating in Egypt, Abdel Aal said the Minister of Finance attaches great importance to the role played by civil society institutions and the business community in supporting the national economy.
She explained that the tangible positive outcomes achieved through the first package of tax facilitations—particularly its direct contribution to higher voluntary compliance rates—provided a strong incentive to introduce a second package to build on this success. She added that the new measures were presented for societal dialogue to gather the views of development partners, address the challenges they face, and reinforce the principles of partnership and transparency.
Abdel Aal highlighted additional incentives introduced by the Ministry of Finance for businesses joining the simplified tax regime, including access to financing programmes offered in coordination with the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency (MSMEDA). These incentives complement the benefits stipulated under Law No. 6 of 2025, which applies to projects with annual turnover not exceeding EGP 20m and sets a graduated income tax scale with a maximum rate of 1.5%.
She noted that the law is designed to reassure taxpayers, encourage integration into the formal economy, broaden the tax base, and enhance fiscal sustainability.
In support of digital transformation, Abdel Aal announced the launch of a mobile application for real estate disposal tax, allowing individuals to notify the authority of transactions, pay the 2.5% tax electronically, and obtain tax clearance in a simplified and seamless manner. She also referred to the establishment of an electronic consultation platform that enables the business community to submit feedback on draft laws, decisions, and other ETA issuances before their release.
She pointed to recent developments in the central clearing system, which now facilitate electronic offsetting between taxpayers’ credit and debit balances. Abdel Aal also announced the issuance of a comprehensive guideline on the tax treatment of exported services in line with international standards, alongside the start of work to establish mechanisms separating commercial audits from transfer pricing audits. A new stage has also been introduced to review taxpayers’ appeals against the outcomes of transfer pricing examinations.
The ETA head further announced the launch of premium tax service centres, designed to deliver a modern and efficient tax experience by streamlining procedures, reducing congestion, and eliminating long waiting times. She said the initiative aims to present the Tax Authority as a supportive partner to economic activity.
According to Abdel Aal, the centres will provide a fully integrated range of services under one roof, including tax registration, awareness of tax facilitation measures, investor support, and technical assistance for digital systems such as e-invoicing and e-receipts, effectively applying the one-stop-shop model.
She added that the second package also targets support for several key sectors. In tourism, departure fees will be unified in response to sector demands. In industry, the development fee on cement will be unified across all types—white and black—marking a significant shift in the approach to managing sector-related fees.
Abdel Aal stressed that the Egyptian Tax Authority will continue to receive and promptly address issues raised by the tax community. She noted that during the conference, ETA officials responded to all technical inquiries from participants, including representatives of Austrian investors in Egypt, reinforcing mutual trust between the Ministry of Finance, the Tax Authority, and the investment community.",600,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.7992459535598755,2026-02-03T09:43:48.591129

The Greenland Gambit and the Erosion of Article 5
Financial Sovereignty and the 5% GDP Defence Pivot
Moscow’s Watchful Eye on the Deep Crisis
A Fragile Edifice of Deterrence
When 1,500 American paratroopers quietly packed their gear and departed from a strategic base near the Ukrainian border last October, the silence from Washington was louder than the transport planes. In Romania, a frontline ally, the withdrawal felt less like a routine rotation and more like a crack in the foundation of the world’s most powerful military alliance.
For decades, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) operated on a simple, ironclad promise: an attack on one is an attack on all. But as defence ministers prepare to gather in Brussels on 12 February, that certainty is being replaced by a profound sense of trepidation. A toxic cocktail of territorial disputes, disparaging rhetoric, and shifting American priorities has left the alliance’s “Article 5” collective defence guarantee looking increasingly fragile.
The central crisis facing NATO today is no longer just about budgets or hardware, but about the erosion of trust. While European allies and Canada are pumping billions into their militaries to counter Russian aggression, the political rift between Washington and its partners—exemplified by renewed American interest in acquiring Greenland—has reached a point where Moscow now openly questions the West’s resolve to act as a unified front.
The Greenland Gambit and the Erosion of Article 5
The most visible sign of this “transatlantic chill” is the recurring tension over Greenland. What began as a dismissed suggestion by President Donald Trump has evolved into a persistent diplomatic wound. Though the Danish territory remains self-governing, the rhetoric surrounding its potential “acquisition” by the United States has struck at the heart of NATO’s sovereign equality principle.
“This episode is significant because it crossed an invisible line,” says Sophia Besch, a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe. In a recent analysis of the Greenland crisis, Besch argued that the breach weakens the alliance permanently, even without the use of force or sanctions. The implication that a senior partner might coerce a smaller ally into ceding territory undermines the very rules-based order the alliance was built to protect. This unpredictability is echoed in the US Senate, where Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Lisa Murkowski recently warned that suggesting the US might seize or coerce the sale of allied territory sends a message of instability that gives adversaries exactly what they want: proof that democratic alliances are brittle.
Financial Sovereignty and the 5% GDP Defence Pivot
In a desperate bid to “Trump-proof” their security, European nations and Canada have radically altered their fiscal trajectories. In July 2025, member states agreed to a landmark surge in spending, pledging to invest 5% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) into defence and security-linked projects. By 2035, the alliance aims for financial parity, with non-US members spending 3.5% of GDP on core military functions alongside an additional 1.5% earmarked for security-adjacent infrastructure. This secondary investment focuses on modernising strategic bridges to support heavy armour transport, upgrading deep-water ports for rapid reinforcement, and hardening civilian airports against the rising threat of cyber-sabotage.
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has publicly praised these efforts, crediting the pressure from Washington for making the alliance stronger than ever. However, behind the scenes, diplomats suggest Rutte’s flattery is a survival tactic. His conspicuous silence on the Greenland dispute highlights the delicate balancing act required to keep the US at the table while European partners grapple with the reality of a shifting American commitment.
Moscow’s Watchful Eye on the Deep Crisis
The internal friction has not escaped the Kremlin’s notice. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recently described the situation as a “major disorder in Europe,” noting that Moscow is watching the cracks with keen interest. For the Russian leadership, NATO’s ability to deter a wider war depends entirely on the conviction that the US will retaliate if the conflict spreads beyond Ukraine. Lavrov told reporters that it was previously difficult to imagine NATO members being at such odds over territory, suggesting that the current rift signals a deep crisis within the organisation.
This perceived weakness coincides with a surge in Russian hybrid activity across Europe. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned this week that Russia remains a major long-term security threat, citing a wave of cyber-attacks on critical energy grids, mysterious drone flights over military bases, and the physical sabotage of subsea infrastructure. As US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth prepares to send his deputy to the upcoming ministerial meeting, questions about Washington’s “Pivot to the Arctic” and its commitment to European soil continue to mount.
A Fragile Edifice of Deterrence
The looming February 12 meeting is expected to focus heavily on the security of the High North, where Greenland sits as a strategic gateway. Yet, without a clear reaffirmation of US troop levels in Europe, the edifice of deterrence remains at risk. A report from the EU Institute for Security Studies warns that adversaries are beginning to believe they can test, sabotage, and escalate without triggering a unified response.
In his year-end address, Mark Rutte reminded the alliance of the stakes, noting that Russia has brought large-scale war back to the continent on a scale not seen since the days of “our grandfathers or great-grandfathers.” Whether the alliance can move past the rhetoric of real estate and return to the business of collective security remains the defining question of 2026. For now, the transatlantic rift serves as a reminder that the greatest threat to NATO may not be the enemy at the gates, but the lack of confidence among those standing behind them.",933,daily_news_egypt,negative,0.7694549560546875,2026-02-03T09:45:06.523798

Under the arrangement, NBE is acting as facility agent, lead arranger, documentation bank, and bookrunner, with a participation of EGP 920m. Bank Al Baraka Egypt is participating as an arranger with a contribution of EGP 500m, underscoring the strength of cooperation between the two banks and their capacity to execute large-scale financing transactions.
The signing ceremony was attended by Mohamed El-Etreby, Chief Executive Officer of the National Bank of Egypt; Hazem Hegazy, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairperson of Bank Al Baraka Egypt; Soha El-Turky, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of NBE; Yasser Zeidan, Chairperson of Al Qamzi Developments; alongside senior representatives from both banks and the company.
Mohamed El-Etreby said NBE’s participation in the syndicated facility reflects the bank’s strategy to provide integrated financing solutions that support clients’ expansion plans and contribute to sustainable economic growth. He noted that real estate development remains a key sector for job creation and economic activity.
El-Etreby added that NBE is committed to building effective banking partnerships that help finance projects with real economic value, particularly those supporting sustainable urban development and aligning with the state’s vision for comprehensive growth, as part of the bank’s national role in backing vital sectors of the economy.
Hazem Hegazy said Bank Al Baraka Egypt is proud to contribute EGP 500m to the financing, highlighting the project’s role in creating job opportunities and delivering added value to society. He described the SEAZEN project as a qualitative addition to North Coast developments and a reflection of the Egyptian banking sector’s ability to support major projects that advance the state’s economic and urban objectives.
“We will continue to play a pivotal role in financing strategic projects that have a tangible impact on the Egyptian economy,” Hegazy said.
Soha El-Turky said the financing underscores NBE’s confidence in Al Qamzi’s financial strength, operational expertise, and the feasibility of the SEAZEN project, which she described as a distinctive addition to North Coast developments. She added that the facility aligns with NBE’s role in supporting nationwide urban development plans and strengthening partnerships with the private sector to create integrated and sustainable communities.
El-Turky affirmed that the bank will continue to support serious and value-adding projects that stimulate economic growth and enhance Egypt’s development capacity.
Yasser Zeidan said Al Qamzi is accelerating construction works across its projects, including SEAZEN, with the aim of completing development ahead of schedule and commencing early handovers. He noted that securing syndicated financing from Egypt’s leading banking institutions represents a strong vote of confidence in the company’s credibility, execution capabilities, and the experience of its founders in delivering major developments in Egypt and the UAE.
He added that the company is currently achieving high execution rates at the SEAZEN project, positioning it as one of the most prominent developments on the North Coast.
The SEAZEN project spans 204 feddans at kilometre 170 in the Dabaa area on the North Coast, with total investments estimated at around EGP 23bn. The development comprises a range of fully finished residential units, from chalets to villas, and features terraced architectural designs rising more than 52 metres above sea level, offering direct sea views from multiple units. Green spaces account for more than 85% of the total project area, alongside a comprehensive mix of integrated facilities and services catering to all age groups.",588,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.6551946401596069,2026-02-03T09:45:33.833841

With the new service, Octane becomes the first company in Egypt to digitise toll gate and truck-weighing payments for light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles nationwide, using Near Field Communication (NFC) technology.
The initiative enables logistics companies and transport fleets to move seamlessly through more than 500 toll gates and weighing stations across the country, eliminating cash handling and paper-based settlement processes.
Through O-Tolls, companies can execute secure, instant digital payments while gaining real-time visibility into toll-related transactions. This enhanced transparency strengthens financial oversight, improves budgeting and planning accuracy, and boosts overall fleet management efficiency, while significantly reducing the risk of fraud or revenue leakage.
The service also improves the driver experience by minimising stoppage time and operational delays. Toll fees are a major cost component for logistics operators, accounting for 10% to 15% of total operating expenses (OPEX) for logistics and distribution companies, giving the solution strategic importance for the sector.
Amr Gamal, co-founder and chief executive of Octane, said the launch reinforces the company’s position as Egypt’s largest integrated digital payments network for fleets.
“Our mission is to digitise every aspect of vehicle-related spending, enabling organisations to transition from fragmented, cash-only models to a unified digital system that delivers accurate spend visibility and enhances financial planning,” Gamal said.
He added that strong early uptake—more than 100 companies joining within the first month—reflects the transport and logistics sector’s growing demand for technology-driven solutions that improve operational efficiency and ensure end-to-end cost control.
Backed by investors including Elsewedy Group, Algebra Ventures and El Shorouk, Octane recorded significant operational growth in 2025, processing more than EGP 13bn in digital transactions during the year. The company currently serves over 3,000 clients, manages the consumption of more than 270,000 vehicles, and tracks over 500 million litres of fuel through its platform.
Octane operates an integrated ecosystem that includes digital fuel payments, O-Store, a virtual marketplace for fleet supplies; O-Care, a nationwide network linking vehicles to more than 300 service centres; and Mint, an AI-powered smart maintenance application. With the launch of O-Tolls, the ecosystem now offers an end-to-end digital payment solution covering all major cost components of fleet operations, including tolls.",386,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8778790235519409,2026-02-04T09:46:44.511205

Speaking at the 9th Capital Markets Summit, titled “Fintech: The Path to Investment Inclusion,” Farid stated that recent amendments to listing rules were designed to enable growth-stage companies to access the benefits of public listing. He cited the Egyptian Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) model as a successful practical example of regulatory flexibility, allowing promising firms to secure funding and institutional visibility without being restricted by traditional listing paths.
Farid noted that there is a direct correlation between confidence in regulatory reforms and overall market confidence, adding that the more market participants believe in the feasibility of these reforms, the greater the appetite for investment and trading. He explained that listing on the exchange makes companies more attractive for mergers and acquisitions due to the transparency, disclosure, and structural discipline required of public entities.
The chairperson also addressed the role of technology in driving investment inclusion, highlighting the implementation of electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) protocols. This regulatory shift has been foundational for the development of fractional real estate investment, resulting in more than 21 applications to establish investment funds in this field, whereas only two such funds existed in the Egyptian market prior to these changes.
Regarding market infrastructure, Farid explained that the development of the trading system for the secondary bond market is a vital step toward enhancing efficiency. He stated that this system helps establish an accurate yield curve reflecting supply and demand, which supports informed investment decisions and pricing transparency. He underscored that genuine reform is a participatory process requiring a level of readiness from companies and institutions that matches that of the regulator.
Farid observed that many current market tools are the result of long-term strategic planning, pointing out that work on financial derivatives began in 2007 and the short-selling mechanism in 2003. He argued that listing contributes to a fundamental transformation in management style and corporate governance, stressing that companies must invest in human capital and training to achieve long-term sustainability.
The opening session, moderated by Fatma Salah, Managing Editor of Al-Borsa newspaper, was attended by Finance Minister Ahmed Kouchouk, Egyptian Exchange Chairperson Islam Azzam, and various officials from investment entities. Farid concluded by stating that when regulatory rules are drafted with a developmental vision, they become a true driver for economic growth rather than just a formal framework.",425,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.5411690473556519,2026-02-04T09:46:47.333004

The move, aimed at ensuring market stability ahead of the holy month, follows an extensive meeting between Farouk and the Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce, the Chamber of Food Industries, and major producers. During the talks, private sector representatives committed to maintaining or reducing current price levels to support consumer purchasing power during the high-consumption season.
Farouk confirmed that the primary “Ahlan Ramadan” exhibitions in Cairo and Giza are also scheduled to open next week. He directed an immediate increase in the supply of basic commodities and Ramadan-specific goods, known as “Yamish,” across all markets. The minister emphasised that the state is prioritising the provision of strategic commodities and is closely monitoring national reserves to ensure safe stock levels are maintained through cooperation with the private sector.
The initiative includes the expansion of permanent stalls within commercial chains that will offer the same discounts found in the main exhibitions. Farouk emphasised the importance of coordination with provincial governors to ensure that these outlets are established promptly and operate efficiently. He also called for strict adherence to safety standards, including civil defence and fire protection requirements, to ensure a secure shopping environment for the expected high volume of citizens.
The meeting was attended by a wide range of officials and industry leaders, including Deputy Minister Walid Abul Magd, Federation of Chambers of Commerce Vice Presidents Hany Mahmoud and Amr Abu El-Oyoun, and Ashraf El-Gezairy, Chairman of the Chamber of Food Industries. Other participants included Alaa Ezz, Secretary General of the International Chamber of Commerce, and provincial chamber heads Mohamed El-Fayoumi, Akram El-Shafei, and Karam Kurdi. Representing the ministry were Assistant Minister for Oversight Hossam El-Garahi, spokesperson Ahmed Kamal, and Managing Director Mohamed El-Mahrouqi.
Farouk concluded by stating that the ministry is implementing a comprehensive plan to regulate markets and replenish stocks immediately to prevent any shortages.

The agreement aligns with Banque du Caire’s strategy to promote financial inclusion and expand financing directed to the SME sector.
The agreement was signed by Basil Rahmy, CEO of MSMEDA, and Bahaa El Shafie, Deputy CEO of Banque du Caire, in the presence of Hussein Abaza, Chairperson and CEO of Banque du Caire; Ahmed Effat, Deputy CEO; Ayman Khattab, Head of Financial Institutions; Nadia Alaa El-Din Ibrahim, Acting Head of the SME Group at the bank; Mohamed Medhat, Deputy CEO of MSMEDA; and Mohamed Osama Bakry, Head of the Central Sector for SME Financing.
Abaza said the continued cooperation with MSMEDA reflects the strong mutual trust and long-standing strategic partnership between the two institutions. He noted that the new agreement will help provide sustainable financing sources for SMEs, supporting production expansion and contributing to the creation of new job opportunities.
He added that supporting the SME sector remains a top priority for Banque du Caire, pursued through an integrated framework of financial and non-financial solutions developed over years of accumulated experience. This approach enables project owners to grow and enhance their competitiveness, while contributing to the state’s objectives related to financial inclusion and sustainable development.
Rahmy, for his part, praised the ongoing cooperation between MSMEDA and Banque du Caire in supporting various types of enterprises, noting that the two sides have previously signed financing agreements exceeding EGP 5bn. These include 28 contracts for small enterprise financing worth EGP 507m, in addition to 20 microfinance contracts totalling EGP 4.5bn.
He added that the new agreement will facilitate access to financing for a wide range of projects nationwide, leveraging Banque du Caire’s extensive branch network. Funding will focus on industrial and productive activities, entrepreneurship, and information technology, in line with the state’s strategy to support local production and expand enterprise creation to provide sustainable employment opportunities for young people, particularly recent graduates.
The agreement underscores Banque du Caire’s commitment to the SME sector as a strategic pillar of its operations and reinforces its position as a leading financier of SMEs in the Egyptian banking market. The bank continues to leverage its strong track record, accumulated expertise, and broad geographic presence to deliver tailored financial and non-financial solutions that enhance growth potential, improve operational efficiency, support sustainability, and strengthen competitiveness in line with Egypt’s economic and development goals.",421,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.8742485642433167,2026-02-04T09:47:05.261066

Speaking during a meeting with a delegation from Moody’s Ratings, which included Matt Robinson, Associate Managing Director of Sovereign Risk, and Alexander Perjessy, Vice President and Senior Risk Officer, El-Khatib outlined a comprehensive programme to restructure Egypt’s economic, monetary, and fiscal policies.
The minister stated that recent decisions have led to a “tangible improvement” in net foreign assets and foreign exchange reserves, which have reached unprecedented levels. He added that the government has adopted a “strategic and realistic” approach to energy pricing and subsidy management to correct economic distortions and address inflationary pressures.
On fiscal policy, El-Khatib noted a fundamental shift in coordination with the Ministry of Finance to simplify the tax system. Tax revenues rose by 35% over the past year—the highest rate since 2005—which the minister attributed to a new relationship of trust with the private sector.
The government has prioritised foreign trade by reducing customs clearance times from 16 days to approximately five days, with a further target of two days. El-Khatib said these measures, alongside the decision to operate ports seven days a week, have resulted in annual savings worth billions of dollars and doubled operational efficiency.
Egypt has also removed a significant number of non-tariff barriers that had accumulated over years, according to the minister. He emphasised the country’s full commitment to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules and noted that the state has successfully completed more than 20 technical preventive measures in cooperation with relevant authorities to protect national industry while maintaining an open investment environment.
Regarding the business climate, El-Khatib said the government is re-engineering procedures to reduce the time required for investors to obtain licences from an average of 24 months to less than 90 days. This includes replacing a system that required dealing with 41 different entities for 460 services with a single digital platform and an investment map.
“The main indicator of growth in the coming period is the volume of investment, not just traditional indicators,” El-Khatib said, adding that the state targets a sustainable annual GDP growth rate of between 6% and 7%.
The minister identified five strategic pillars for Egypt’s future growth: renewable energy and data centres; electronic chips and high-tech manufacturing; infrastructure; effective operational models; and artificial intelligence. He also highlighted tourism as a key driver, with a new investment map being prepared for the North Coast and Red Sea to increase hotel capacity.
The Sovereign Fund of Egypt is also shifting its focus toward maximising returns from state assets rather than merely holding them, El-Khatib told the delegation.
Moody’s representatives expressed appreciation for the reforms. Matt Robinson noted the importance of transparency and governance in attracting FDI, while Alexander Perjessy praised progress in energy pricing and the digitalisation of licensing procedures, stating these steps support medium-term economic and financial sustainability.

The air pollution project, which is supplemented by a $9.3m grant from the Global Environment Facility, aims to reduce climate emissions from key sectors and enhance resilience to pollution in the capital. The review took place during a meeting between Al-Mashat and a World Bank delegation led by Gallina Andronova Vincelette, Vice President for Operations Policy and Country Services, where the two sides discussed deepening a partnership that dates back to 1959.
Al-Mashat used the meeting to outline Egypt’s 2025/2026 economic and social development plan, which targets total investments of EGP 3.5trn. Under this framework, the private sector is expected to account for 63% of total investments, while public investment is capped at 37% as part of government efforts to rationalise expenditure and enhance governance.
The minister underscored Egypt’s “Narrative for Comprehensive Development,” an integrated framework developed with the support of over 100 World Bank experts. Al-Mashat stated the narrative embeds environmental sustainability across all growth trajectories, including urban development, water, energy, and transport. She explained that the strategy is set to integrate with a national financing strategy that links development goals to performance-based budgeting.
Strategic discussions also covered the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Strategy, the Business Ready (B-Ready) Report, and the Blue Economy Strategy. Additionally, the delegation discussed Egypt’s selection for the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) Nature, People, and Climate Investment Program, which focuses on advancing climate-smart agriculture and protecting coastal ecosystems.
On the matter of development policy financing, Al-Mashat confirmed that the government and the World Bank have reached an agreement on a structural reform matrix. This matrix is designed to improve economic competitiveness by expanding private sector participation, building fiscal resilience against external shocks, and supporting the green transition through renewable energy expansion and improved utility efficiency in electricity and sanitation services.

Speaking during an open video-conference dialogue with 250 leading Turkish investors participating in the meeting of the Egyptian and Turkish chambers of commerce in New Alamein City, Kouchouk underscored Egypt’s strong competitive advantages, including its advanced infrastructure, strategic geographic location, and wide range of promising investment opportunities.
He said bilateral relations between Egypt and Türkiye are strong, noting that the private sectors in both countries are well positioned to drive further mutual investment. There remains significant potential to expand economic cooperation, particularly in food industries, engineering industries, garments, and home appliances, he added. Kouchouk also stressed that joint memoranda of understanding signed between the Egyptian Chamber of Commerce and its Turkish counterpart represent an important step towards strengthening economic integration.
The finance minister pointed to the strong improvement in Egypt’s economic performance, noting that private sector investment rose by 73% last year and continues to show robust momentum. He highlighted the growing investment inflows into the Suez Canal Economic Zone as a successful model for regional and international partnerships.
Kouchouk also noted a marked improvement in the performance of non-oil merchandise exports and service exports during the last financial year, alongside increased and more diversified foreign direct investment inflows. He said the government’s objective is to position Egypt as a regional hub for production and export, serving markets across the Middle East and the African continent.
He added that first-quarter indicators for the current financial year reflect continued economic improvement, with the private sector leading growth. The government, he said, remains committed to maintaining fiscal discipline while simultaneously stimulating economic activity to improve debt indicators. This discipline, he explained, creates additional fiscal space that will be directed towards greater spending on human development and social protection for the most vulnerable groups.
Kouchouk reaffirmed the government’s commitment to simplifying and facilitating procedures to support private sector growth, ensuring that fiscal policies are more supportive of industrial, productive, and export-oriented activities. He stressed that ongoing tax and customs facilitation measures aim to build a relationship of trust with the business community and enhance the competitiveness of the Egyptian economy.
For his part, Ahmed El-Wakil, Chairperson of the Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce, said he was pleased to host the annual meeting of the Union of Turkish Chambers and Commodity Exchanges in New Alamein City.

2026-02-03,Opinion | There Will Be No Victor in a War on Iran,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/02/03/opinion-there-will-be-no-victor-in-a-war-on-iran/,"The drums of war are beating faster across the Gulf, even as Cairo leads a marathon of diplomatic efforts aimed at defusing an imminent confrontation between Washington and Tehran—a confrontation that would plunge the region into prolonged instability, with catastrophic repercussions lasting for years. In a scene reminiscent of classic “brinkmanship,” President Donald Trump continues to amass U.S. military power in the region, while deliberately leaving a narrow opening for diplomacy—not out of a genuine commitment to peace, but in pursuit of a formula that would extract historic concessions from Iran, satisfy the ambitions of his ally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and neutralise Tehran’s regional leverage.
The conditions Washington is brandishing as a means to avert war are effectively impossible and strike at the core of any nation’s sovereignty. The issue centres on Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes and its regional policies—policies that some may argue run counter to mechanisms of regional cooperation. Yet Iran, ultimately, is not Venezuela. Tehran has reportedly conveyed to the U.S. administration its outright rejection of these demands, while Washington insists on immediate compliance and unconditional concessions. Historically, imposing unacceptable terms in negotiations has often served as a pretext for war or for the imposition of sanctions by the stronger party against the weaker—and this is precisely the dynamic unfolding today.
For now, channels remain open between Tehran and Washington to reduce escalation. Still, Trump—adept at brinkmanship and negotiating under fire—appears inclined, to some extent, towards launching a limited strike against Iran. In recent days, U.S. forces completing their build-up near the waters of the Arabian Gulf have begun large-scale aerial exercises, possibly employing the same deceptive scenario once used by Egypt during the October 1973 War, when military drills transitioned into a decisive conflict that ultimately led to the recovery of the Sinai Peninsula.
Prof. Hatem Sadek
Trump, a master of the carrot-and-stick approach, recently stated: “We have a very big naval force near Iran—bigger than what we had near Venezuela,” underscoring the scale of the current U.S. military deployment. He did not rule out a diplomatic resolution with Tehran. The American presence in the Gulf provides operational flexibility that does not necessarily imply an imminent military strike; it could just as easily translate into a tightened blockade on Iran. Meanwhile, the uncertainty surrounding the president’s final decision only compounds the crisis and raises pressing questions: Is this unprecedented show of force intended to alter the outlook of the current Iranian leadership, or does it signal a broader effort aimed at regime change?
Realistically, no one knows what Trump ultimately intends to do. Yet if we move from intentions to outcomes, any strike at this stage would weaken Iran’s ruling establishment, potentially reinvigorate popular protests, and expand the cycle of violence and counter-violence in a country already suffering from severe economic collapse. The Iranian rial has plummeted to over one million to the dollar, reflecting the depth of the crisis.
Warfare itself has fundamentally changed over the past decade due to the rise of drones and artificial intelligence technologies. In 2025, Iran carried out large-scale attacks involving the launch of more than 1,000 drones towards Israel, alongside expanded use of ballistic missiles and stealth aircraft. These tools reduce the duration of conflict and minimise the need for direct territorial occupation—along with the heavy military and economic burdens such occupation would impose on an occupying power. Logically, growing concern for living standards and deep reliance on global trade no longer allow for prolonged wars of the kind seen in the twentieth century. Even if the United States were to strike Iran, the conflict would likely resemble the brief twelve-day war of 2025 rather than a drawn-out campaign.
Given the Trump administration’s conduct across political and military arenas worldwide, it is difficult to decipher its precise strategy towards Iran, let alone the metrics of success or failure—particularly in light of past U.S. experiences in conflict zones, from Vietnam to Afghanistan and Iraq, and ultimately Venezuela.
In other words, Washington may succeed in coercing Tehran into compliance, but the story would not end there. Weakening state authority would inevitably embolden the street and could ultimately lead to the collapse of the regime itself—along with any concessions extracted under duress. The conclusion is already clear: a war on Iran will not produce a military victory, as some in Washington or Tel Aviv may imagine. Instead, it would create a power vacuum at the heart of the Middle East, inviting adventurists and opportunists alike.
Undermining Iran’s central state without a cohesive national alternative would not yield democracy; it would mean the “Afghanisation” of the Iranian plateau—turning oil fields and remnants of the nuclear programme into battlegrounds for militias and ethnic gangs. At that point, the world would realise, too late, that the cost of peace—no matter how high—was far cheaper than the bill for a war from which no one would emerge victorious.

2026-02-04,GAFI participates in Egypt-Türkiye Business Forum to boost economic partnership,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/02/04/gafi-participates-in-egypt-turkiye-business-forum-to-boost-economic-partnership/,"Mohamed El-Gawsaky, CEO of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI), said Egypt offers a strong and stable investment environment, supported by comprehensive economic reforms and clear policies aimed at streamlining procedures, reducing costs, enhancing transparency and facilitating access to European, African and Middle Eastern markets.
El-Gawsaky said these advantages position Egypt as an ideal base for expanding business and production across key sectors, including industry, manufacturing, logistics, renewable energy and digital transformation.
He made the remarks during GAFI’s participation in the Egypt-Türkiye Business Forum, held under the theme “Economic Opportunities for a Strategic Partnership”. The forum brought together senior government officials and business leaders from both countries and was attended by around 400 Egyptian and Turkish companies, underscoring the depth of economic ties between Cairo and Ankara.
El-Gawsaky highlighted the strategic nature of Egyptian-Turkish relations, noting that the two countries’ geographic locations and economic capabilities create strong opportunities for expanding partnerships and exchanging expertise.
He added that Egypt is translating positive economic indicators into tangible outcomes by offering bankable investment opportunities and fostering a business-friendly environment. Digital transformation, he said, plays a central role in streamlining procedures and accelerating investment projects, ensuring high levels of transparency and efficiency in services provided to investors.
El-Gawsaky stressed that clarity and transparency form the foundation of Egypt’s cooperation with its partners, alongside a focus on sustainable development through collaboration rather than competition. This approach, he said, aims to generate genuine investment opportunities and support shared economic growth benefiting both the Egyptian and Turkish peoples.

He further noted that Egyptian-Turkish relations have played a key role in supporting Turkish investments in Egypt and enhancing industrial and technological integration between the two countries, contributing to job creation and sustainable development on both sides. He added that GAFI offers a package of incentives and fast-track measures, including the Golden Licence, while facilitating all necessary procedures to address challenges faced by Turkish investors.
El-Gawsaky also pointed to industrial and investment integration, combined with digital transformation, as a promising avenue for deepening cooperation between Egypt and Türkiye. He said Egypt is consolidating its position as a regional hub for investment and production, supported by strong political will, advanced infrastructure and a clear vision for sustainable economic growth.
For his part, Adel Lamie, board member of the Egyptian Businessmen’s Association and co-chair of the Egypt-Türkiye Business Council, said the forum represents a real opportunity to launch new economic partnerships and reflects the strength of bilateral economic relations. He stressed the importance of adopting a forward-looking, development-oriented vision based on integration to boost trade and investment flows, anticipating a broader presence of Turkish products in the Egyptian market and Egyptian products in Türkiye in the coming period.
The forum was held as part of Egypt’s efforts—led by the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade and GAFI—to support economic partnership with Türkiye. It provided a platform for direct dialogue between government institutions and the business community, aimed at fostering a stable and attractive investment climate and opening direct channels of communication to support mutual investments and shared interests.",526,daily_news_egypt,positive,0.842666506767273,2026-02-05T09:46:31.627610

2026-02-04,"Opinion | Britain, Canada, and China: Trump’s Tariff Strategy and the Fracturing West",https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2026/02/04/opinion-britain-canada-and-china-trumps-tariff-strategy-and-the-fracturing-west/,"In late January 2026, the latest escalation in U.S. trade rhetoric was not merely another episode in a familiar cycle of tensions. Rather, it signalled a deeper shift in how the United States is managing its relationships with its closest allies. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s visit to Beijing—and the economic agreements and trade facilitation measures that accompanied it—highlighted a reality that can no longer be ignored: the Western world is no longer a unified bloc in its approach to China, but rather a constellation of diverging interests attempting to reposition themselves within a rapidly transforming international order.
Donald Trump’s response brought this divergence sharply into focus. While his warning to London remained largely political in tone, his message to Canada was unmistakably punitive. The threat to impose sweeping 100% tariffs on Canadian goods should Ottawa proceed with any economic rapprochement with Beijing went far beyond a conventional trade dispute. It amounted to an attempt to redraw the boundaries of what is permissible—and impermissible—within the Western alliance itself.
This posture cannot be understood outside the logic underpinning the “America First” doctrine. Within this framework, international relations are not measured by the depth of alliances but by immediate calculations of gain and loss. China, in Trump’s view, is not simply a rising economic competitor; it represents a structural threat to American dominance—across technological leadership, control of global supply chains, and even the rules governing international trade. From this perspective, any Western engagement with Beijing becomes a strategic vulnerability rather than a sovereign policy choice.

Yet this logic, however internally consistent it may appear, collides with a far more complex and less controllable global reality. Post-Brexit Britain faces economic pressures that make disengagement from the world’s second-largest economy an increasingly costly option. Canada, despite its deep and longstanding reliance on the U.S. market, has come to recognise that total dependence on a single partner in an era defined by volatility and uncertainty carries strategic risks no less serious than limited engagement with China. In this context, economic diversification ceases to be an act of disloyalty and instead becomes a mechanism for survival.
Notably, neither London nor Ottawa has sought direct confrontation with Washington or an overt crossing of red lines. Official rhetoric in both capitals has emphasised that opening channels with China does not imply a strategic realignment or abandonment of the U.S. partnership. Nevertheless, the American response suggests that even a narrow margin for manoeuvre is no longer tolerated. Herein lies the core of the crisis: when alliances shift from being partnerships rooted in mutual interests to arrangements defined by constant loyalty tests, erosion begins from within.
This erosion does not remain confined to the transatlantic sphere. The Middle East, long accustomed to navigating shifting power balances, is watching these developments with characteristic pragmatism. Growing U.S. pressure on its Western allies sends mixed signals to the region’s states. On the one hand, the United States remains an indispensable security partner; on the other, its policies appear increasingly unpredictable and more willing to weaponise economic tools for political ends. Within this relative vacuum, China finds expanding space to deepen its regional presence—through investment, technology partnerships, and even diplomatic roles once dominated by Washington.
The real danger lies not in the proliferation of partnerships or the diversification of alliances, but in the drift towards rigid polarisation. A full-scale U.S.–China trade war would not merely reshape relations between the two powers; it would disrupt global supply chains, fuel inflation, and trigger volatility in energy and food markets—costs borne disproportionately by middle-income and developing economies rather than by the major powers themselves.
Ultimately, this escalation produces no clear winners. The United States may extract short-term tactical concessions, but at the risk of undermining the trust that has sustained its alliances for decades. Its allies, meanwhile, gain greater economic flexibility, but at an uncertain political and security cost. Between these poles, a multipolar international system continues to take shape—one governed less by absolute loyalties than by delicate balances and complex calculations.
Perhaps the central lesson of this moment is that the era of unilateral dictates is receding. Managing a multipolar world cannot be achieved through tariff threats alone, but requires a more agile diplomacy—one capable of accommodating contradiction rather than suppressing it. In such a world, the defining question is no longer who we stand with, but rather: how do we move forward without being forced into a zero-sum alignment trap?
